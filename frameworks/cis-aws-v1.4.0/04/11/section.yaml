name: 4.11 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for changes to Network Access
  Control Lists (NACL)
description: Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail
  Logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms.
  NACLs are used as a stateless packet filter to control ingress and egress traffic
  for subnets within a VPC. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established
  for changes made to NACLs.
