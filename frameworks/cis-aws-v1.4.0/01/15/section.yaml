name: 1.15 Ensure IAM Users Receive Permissions Only Through Groups
description: "IAM users are granted access to services, functions, and data through\
  \ IAM policies. There are three ways to define policies for a user: 1) Edit the\
  \ user policy directly, aka an inline, or user, policy; 2) attach a policy directly\
  \ to a user; 3) add the user to an IAM group that has an attached policy. \n\nOnly\
  \ the third implementation is recommended."
