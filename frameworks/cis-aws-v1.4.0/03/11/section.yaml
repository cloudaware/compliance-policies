name: 3.11 Ensure that Object-level logging for read events is enabled for S3 bucket
description: "S3 object-level API operations such as GetObject, DeleteObject, and\
  \ PutObject are called data events. By default, CloudTrail trails don't log data\
  \ events and so it is recommended to enable Object-level logging for S3 buckets."
