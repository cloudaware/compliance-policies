name: 4.2.1 Passwords are protected against brute-force password guessing
description: |-
  Passwords are protected against brute-force password guessing by implementing at least one of:
  - multi-factor authentication
  - 'throttling' the rate of attempts, so that the number of times the user must wait between attempts increases with each unsuccessful attempt – you shouldn’t allow more than 10 guesses in 5 minutes
  - locking accounts after no more than 10 unsuccessful attempts
