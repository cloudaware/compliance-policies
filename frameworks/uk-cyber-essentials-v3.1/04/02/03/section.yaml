name: 4.2.3 Support users to choose unique passwords for their work accounts
description: |-
  Support users to choose unique passwords for their work accounts by:
  - educating people about avoiding common passwords, such as a pet's name, common keyboard patterns or passwords they have used elsewhere. This could include teaching people to use the password generator feature built into some password managers.
  - encouraging people to choose longer passwords by promoting the use of multiple words (a minimum of three) to create a password (such as the NCSCâ€™s guidance on using three random words)
  - providing usable secure storage for passwords (for example a password manager or secure locked cabinet) with clear information about how and when it can be used.
  - not enforcing regular password expiry
  - not enforcing password complexity requirements
