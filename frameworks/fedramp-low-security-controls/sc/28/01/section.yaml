name: "SC-28(1) Cryptographic Protection (L)(M)(H)"
description: |-
  Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of
  the following information at rest on [FedRAMP Assignment: all information system components
  storing Federal data or system data that must be protected at the High or Moderate impact
  levels]: [Assignment: organization-defined information].

  **SC-28 (1) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**
  
  **Guidance**: Organizations should select a mode of protection that is targeted towards the
  relevant threat scenarios.
  
  Examples:
  
  A. Organizations may apply full disk encryption (FDE) to a mobile device where the
  primary threat is loss of the device while storage is locked.
  
  B. For a database application housing data for a single customer, encryption at the file
  system level would often provide more protection than FDE against the more likely threat
  of an intruder on the operating system accessing the storage.

  C. For a database application housing data for multiple customers, encryption with
  unique keys for each customer at the database record level may be more appropriate.
