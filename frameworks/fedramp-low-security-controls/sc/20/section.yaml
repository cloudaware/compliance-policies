  **SC-20 Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**
  
  **Guidance**: SC-20 applies to use of external authoritative DNS to access a CSO from
  outside the boundary.

  **Guidance**: External authoritative DNS servers may be located outside an authorized
  environment. Positioning these servers inside an authorized boundary is encouraged.
  
  **Guidance**: CSPs are recommended to self-check DNSSEC configuration through one
  of many available analyzers such as [Sandia National Labs](https://dnsviz.net)
  
  **Requirement**: Control Description should include how DNSSEC is implemented on
  authoritative DNS servers to supply valid responses to external DNSSEC requests.
