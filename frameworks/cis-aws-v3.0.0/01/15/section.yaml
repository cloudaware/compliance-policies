name: 1.15 Ensure IAM Users Receive Permissions Only Through Groups - Level 1 (Automated)
description: "IAM users are granted access to services, functions, and data through\
  \ IAM policies. There are four ways to define policies for a user: 1) Edit the user\
  \ policy directly, aka an inline, or user, policy; 2) attach a policy directly to\
  \ a user; 3) add the user to an IAM group that has an attached policy; 4) add the\
  \ user to an IAM group that has an inline policy. \n\nOnly the third implementation\
  \ is recommended."
