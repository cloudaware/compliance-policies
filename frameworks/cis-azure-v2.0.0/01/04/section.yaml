name: 1.4 Ensure Access Review is Set Up for External Users in Azure AD Privileged
  Identity Management - Level 2 (Manual)
description: "This recommendation extends guest access review by utilizing the Azure\
  \ AD Privileged Identity Management feature provided in Azure AD Premium P2.\n\n\
  Azure AD is extended to include Azure AD B2B collaboration, allowing you to invite\
  \ people from outside your organization to be guest users in your cloud account\
  \ and sign in with their own work, school, or social identities. Guest users allow\
  \ you to share your company's applications and services with users from any other\
  \ organization, while maintaining control over your own corporate data. \n\nWork\
  \ with external partners, large or small, even if they don't have Azure AD or an\
  \ IT department. A simple invitation and redemption process lets partners use their\
  \ own credentials to access your company's resources a a guest user."
