name: 1.7 Ensure that a Custom Bad Password List is set to  'Enforce' for your Organization
  - Level 1 (Manual)
description: |-
  Microsoft Azure provides a Global Banned Password policy that applies to Azure administrative and normal user accounts. This is not applied to user accounts that are synced from an on-premise Active Directory unless Azure AD Connect is used and you enable EnforceCloudPasswordPolicyForPasswordSyncedUsers.
  Please see the list in default values on the specifics of this policy. To further password security, it is recommended to further define a custom banned password policy.
