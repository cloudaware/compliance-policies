name: 1.1 Security Defaults
description: "**IMPORTANT:** The Azure \"Security Defaults\" recommendations represent\
  \ an entry-level set of recommendations which will be relevant to organizations\
  \ and tenants that are either just starting to use Azure as an IaaS solution, or\
  \ are only utilizing a bare minimum feature set such as the freely licensed tier\
  \ of Azure Active Directory. Security Defaults recommendations are intended to ensure\
  \ that these entry-level use cases are still capable of establishing a strong baseline\
  \ of secure configuration. \n\n**If your subscription is licensed to use Azure AD\
  \ Premium P1 or P2, it is strongly recommended that the \"Security Defaults\" section\
  \ (this section and the recommendations therein) be bypassed in favor of the use\
  \ of \"Conditional Access.\"**"
