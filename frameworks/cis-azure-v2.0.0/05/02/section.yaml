name: 5.2 Monitoring using Activity Log Alerts
description: "The recommendations provided in this section are intended to provide\
  \ entry-level alerting for crucial activities on a tenant account. These recommended\
  \ activities **should** be tuned to your needs. By default, each of these Activity\
  \ Log Alerts tends to guide the reader to alerting at the \"Subscription-wide\"\
  \ level which will capture and alert on rules triggered by all resources and resource\
  \ groups contained within a subscription. This is not an ideal rule set for Alerting\
  \ within larger and more complex organizations.\n\nWhile this section provides recommendations\
  \ for the creation of **Activity Log Alerts** specifically, Microsoft Azure supports\
  \ four different types of alerts:\n- Metric Alerts\n- Log Alerts\n- Activity Log\
  \ Alerts\n- Smart Detection Alerts\n\nAll Azure services (Microsoft provided or\
  \ otherwise) that can generate alerts are assigned a \"Resource provider namespace\"\
  \ when they are registered in an Azure tenant. The recommendations in this section\
  \ are in no way exhaustive of the plethora of available \"Providers\" or \"Resource\
  \ Types.\" The Resource Providers that are registered in your Azure Tenant can be\
  \ located in your Subscription. Each registered Provider in your environment **may**\
  \ have available \"Conditions\" to raise alerts via Activity Log Alerts. These providers\
  \ should be considered for inclusion in Activity Log Alert rules of your own making.\n\
  \nTo view the registered resource providers in your Subscription(s), use this guide:\
  \ \n\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types\n\
  \nIf you wish to create custom alerting rules for Activity Log Alerts or other alert\
  \ types, please refer to Microsoft documentation:\n\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-create-new-alert-rule"
