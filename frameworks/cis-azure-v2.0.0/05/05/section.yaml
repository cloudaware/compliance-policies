name: 5.5 Ensure that SKU Basic/Consumption is not used on artifacts that need to
  be monitored (Particularly for Production Workloads) - Level 2 (Automated)
description: "The use of Basic or Free SKUs in Azure whilst cost effective have significant\
  \ limitations in terms of what can be monitored and what support can be realized\
  \ from Microsoft. Typically, these SKUâ€™s do not have a service SLA and Microsoft\
  \ will usually refuse to provide support for them. Consequently Basic/Free SKUs\
  \ should never be used for production workloads."
