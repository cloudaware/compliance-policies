name: 4.5.3 Use Azure Active Directory (AAD) Client Authentication and Azure RBAC
  where possible. - Level 1 (Manual)
description: "Cosmos DB can use tokens or AAD for client authentication which in turn\
  \ will use Azure RBAC for authorization. Using AAD is significantly more secure\
  \ because AAD handles the credentials and allows for MFA and centralized management,\
  \ and the Azure RBAC better integrated with the rest of Azure."
