name: "20 Under CPS 234, an APRA-regulated entity must actively maintain an information\
  \ security capability with respect to changes in vulnerabilities and threats. Accordingly,\
  \ an entity would typically adopt an adaptive and forward-looking approach to maintaining\
  \ its information security capability, including ongoing investment in resources,\
  \ skills and controls. This would commonly be achieved through the execution of\
  \ an information security strategy which responds to the changing environment throughout\
  \ the year. The strategy could be informed by existing and emerging information\
  \ security vulnerabilities and threats, contemporary industry practices, information\
  \ security incidents, both internal and external, and known information security\
  \ issues. Oversight of execution of the strategy is normally the responsibility\
  \ of the Board or a delegated governing body with representation from across the\
  \ organisation."
