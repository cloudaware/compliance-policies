  1 An APRA-regulated entity could benefit from developing a training and information security awareness program. This would typically communicate to personnel (staff, contractors and third parties) regarding information security practices, policies and other expectations as well as providing material to assist the Board and other governing bodies to execute their duties. Sound practice would involve tracking training undertaken and testing the understanding of relevant information security policies, both on
  commencement and periodically.
