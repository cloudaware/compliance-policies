  \ and sensitivity3 . This includes infrastructure, ancillary systems such as environmental\
  \ control systems and physical access control systems as well as information assets\
  \ managed by third parties and related parties. Furthermore, APRA-regulated entities\
  \ could benefit from considering the interrelationships between information assets,\
  \ including identifying information assets which are not intrinsically critical\
  \ or sensitive but could be used to compromise information assets which are critical\
  \ or sensitive."
