name: "4 Cryptographic key management refers to the generation, distribution, storage,\
  \ renewal, revocation, recovery, archiving and destruction of encryption keys. Effective\
  \ cryptographic key management ensures that controls are in place to reduce the\
  \ risk of compromise of the security of cryptographic keys. Any compromise of the\
  \ security of cryptographic keys could, in turn, lead to a compromise of the security\
  \ of the information assets protected by the cryptographic technique deployed."
