  \ is a clear understanding of the nature and effectiveness of these arrangements.\
  \ Additionally, while extended or custom support arrangements may partially mitigate\
  \ risk, they are often costly, could provide a false sense of security and can further\
  \ delay remediation of ageing technology. Furthermore, support agreements of this\
  \ nature typically provide hot-fixes or patches for critical vulnerabilities only,\
  \ and remain constrained by the dated security model and design limitations of the\
  \ technology."
