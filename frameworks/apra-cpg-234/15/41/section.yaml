name: "41 Maintaining information assets therefore necessitates a disciplined approach\
  \ to information asset life-cycle management, including a comprehensive understanding\
  \ of assets that support the business, as well as the potential impacts of an information\
  \ security compromise of these assets. Maintenance of information assets can be\
  \ facilitated through the monitoring of end-of-support dates, where available, and\
  \ the active identification of systems, including those that are internally-developed\
  \ and which are no longer invested in or are not secure by design. A technology\
  \ refresh plan with committed resourcing can also facilitate the timely replacement\
  \ of hardware and software."
