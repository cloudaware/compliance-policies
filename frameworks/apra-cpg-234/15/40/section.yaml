name: "40 An important aspect of information asset life-cycle management involves\
  \ minimising vulnerabilities and maintaining support. Information security exposures\
  \ could arise from hardware and software which is outdated or has limited or no\
  \ support (whether through a third party, a related party or in-house). Technology\
  \ that is end-of-life5 , out-of-support or in extended support is typically less\
  \ secure by design, has a dated security model and can take longer, or is unable,\
  \ to be updated to address new threats."
