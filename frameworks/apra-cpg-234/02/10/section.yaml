name: "10 APRA does not seek to impose restrictions on a Boardâ€™s ability to delegate\
  \ information security roles and responsibilities to Board sub-committees, management\
  \ committees or individuals. However, APRA expects that a Board would clearly outline\
  \ how it expects to be engaged with respect to information security, including escalation\
  \ of risks, issues and reporting. Refer to Attachment H for common examples of the\
  \ types of information that the Board might find useful in this regard."
