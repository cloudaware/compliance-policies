name: "29 In order to identify and classify information assets, an APRA-regulated\
  \ entity would benefit from maintaining a classification methodology that provides\
  \ clarity as to what constitutes an information asset, granularity considerations\
  \ and the method for rating criticality and sensitivity. The rating could take into\
  \ account the impact of an information security compromise on an information asset.\
  \ Notably, an information asset could be assessed as having a different rating from\
  \ the perspective of its criticality and sensitivity."
