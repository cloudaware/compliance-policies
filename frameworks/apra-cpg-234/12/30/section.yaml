name: "30 APRA-regulated entities record information assets in various ways, sometimes\
  \ at a very granular level and sometimes at an aggregated level. For example, a\
  \ system can be seen as an aggregation of the underlying components (such as applications,\
  \ databases, operating systems, middleware and data sets) and treated as a single\
  \ information asset for classification purposes. Alternatively, a regulated entity\
  \ could choose to treat each ofthe underlying components as individual information\
  \ assets in their own right. Ultimately, the level of granularity would be sufficient\
  \ to determine the nature and strength of controls required to protect the information\
  \ asset."
