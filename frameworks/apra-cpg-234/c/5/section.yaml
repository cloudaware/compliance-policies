  5 The strength of identification and authentication would typically be commensurate with the impact should an identity be falsified. Common techniques for increasing the strength of identification and authentication include the use of strong password techniques (i.e. length, complexity, re-use limitations and frequency of change), utilisation of cryptographic techniques and increasing the number and type of authentication factors used. Authentication factors include something an individual:
  a. knows - for example, user IDs and passwords;
  b. has - for example, a security token or other devices in the personâ€™s possession used for the generation of one-time passwords;
  c. is - for example, retinal scans, hand scans, signature scans, digital signature, voice scans or other biometrics.
