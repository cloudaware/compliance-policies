name: "45 An understanding of plausible worst case scenarios can help regulated entities\
  \ identify and implement additional controls to prevent or reduce the impact of\
  \ such scenarios. One example is malware that infects computers and encrypts data,\
  \ both on the infected computer and any connected storage, including (corporate)\
  \ networks and cloud storage. Such attacks reinforce the importance of protecting\
  \ the backup environment in the event that the production environment is compromised.\
  \ Common techniques to achieve this include network segmentation, highly restricted\
  \ and segregated access controls and network traffic flow restrictions."
