  \ and related parties necessitates an understanding of the controls in place or\
  \ planned. This can be maintained over time through a combination of interviews,\
  \ surveys, control testing, certifications, contractual reviews, attestations and\
  \ independent assurance assessments. Controls identified can then be compared to\
  \ common industry controls and considered in light of controls within the regulated\
  \ entity as well as the nature of the information assets involved. Any capability\
  \ gaps identified would be addressed in a timely manner."
