name: "82 Under CPS 234, an APRA-regulated entity must ensure that testing is conducted\
  \ by appropriately skilled and functionally independent specialists. For an APRA-regulated\
  \ entity to have confidence in the quality of testing, it is important that testers\
  \ are sufficiently independent in order to provide a bias-free assessment of controls\
  \ (i.e. unimpeded by a conflict of interest). This includes the use of testers who\
  \ do not have operational responsibility for the controls being validated. The level\
  \ of functional independence required would typically be determined by the nature\
  \ and importance of the testing."
