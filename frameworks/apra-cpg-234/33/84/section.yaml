name: "84 Under CPS 234, an APRA-regulated entity’s internal audit function must review\
  \ the design and operating effectiveness of information security controls. In APRA’\
  s view, an approach which achieves comprehensive assurance would involve an audit\
  \ program which assesses all aspects of the information security control environment\
  \ over time. The frequency at which areas to be audited are assessed would take\
  \ into account the impact of an information security compromise and the ability\
  \ to place reliance on other control testing undertaken. Additional assurance work\
  \ may be triggered by changes to vulnerabilities and threats or material changes\
  \ to IT assets."
