name: 83 Internal audit is an important vehicle by which the Board can gain assurance
  that information security is maintained. This assurance would typically be achieved
  through the inclusion of information security within the APRA-regulated entityâ€™s
  internal audit plan. The Board could also choose to gain assurance through expert
  opinion or other means to complement the assurance provided by the internal audit
  function. This typically occurs where the required skills do not reside within the
  internal audit function or the area subject to audit pertains to third parties or
  related parties.
