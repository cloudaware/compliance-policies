name: "3 An APRA-regulated entity could find it useful to maintain a register of approved\
  \ software development tools and associated usage. The regulated entity would typically\
  \ enforce compliance with the register for the purposes of quality control, avoiding\
  \ compromises of the production environment and reducing the risk of introducing\
  \ unexpected vulnerabilities. This would not preclude the use of other tools in\
  \ a non-production environment for the purposes of evaluation and experimentation."
