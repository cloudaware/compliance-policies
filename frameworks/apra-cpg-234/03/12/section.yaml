name: "12 Information security roles and responsibilities are typically located in\
  \ separate business areas, as well as within the IT function itself and in third\
  \ parties and related parties. This can result in issues such as a lack of ownership,\
  \ unclear accountabilities, ineffective oversight and fragmentation of practices\
  \ with respect to information security. APRA regulated entities could address these\
  \ issues by maintaining clear delineation between the responsibilities of each area\
  \ and implementing compensating measures. Compensating measures could include establishing\
  \ a virtual security group comprised of individuals with information security roles\
  \ and responsibilities."
