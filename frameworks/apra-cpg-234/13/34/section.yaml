name: "34 Under CPS 234, an APRA-regulated entity must have information security controls\
  \ to protect its information assets commensurate with, amongst other things, the\
  \ stage at which the information assets are within their life-cycle. This includes\
  \ ensuring that information security controls remain effective at each stage of\
  \ the life-cycle of the information asset and that there is formal allocation of\
  \ responsibility and accountability for the information security of an information\
  \ asset to an information asset owner. Typically, the information asset owner would\
  \ be an individual located within the business function which is most dependent\
  \ on the information asset"
