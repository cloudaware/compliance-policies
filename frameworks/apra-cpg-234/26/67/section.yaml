name: "67 Detection mechanisms typically include scanning, sensing and logging mechanisms\
  \ which can be used to identify potential information security incidents. Monitoring\
  \ processes could include the identification of unusual patterns of behaviour and\
  \ logging that facilitates investigation and preserves forensic evidence. The strength\
  \ and nature of monitoring controls would typically be commensurate with the impact\
  \ of an information security incident. Monitoring processes would consider the broad\
  \ set of events, ranging from the physical hardware layer to higher order business\
  \ activities such as payments and changes to user access."
