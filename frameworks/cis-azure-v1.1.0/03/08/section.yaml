name: 3.8 Ensure 'Trusted Microsoft Services' is enabled for Storage Account access
description: "Some Microsoft services that interact with storage accounts operate\
  \ from networks that can't be granted access through network rules. To help this\
  \ type of service work as intended, allow the set of trusted Microsoft services\
  \ to bypass the network rules. These services will then use strong authentication\
  \ to access the storage account. If the Allow trusted Microsoft services exception\
  \ is enabled, the following services: Azure Backup, Azure Site Recovery, Azure DevTest\
  \ Labs, Azure Event Grid, Azure Event Hubs, Azure Networking, Azure Monitor and\
  \ Azure SQL Data Warehouse (when registered in the subscription), are granted access\
  \ to the storage account."
