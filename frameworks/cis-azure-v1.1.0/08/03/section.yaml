  \ locks sit outside of the Role Based Access Controls (RBAC) hierarchy and, when\
  \ applied, will place restrictions on the resource for all users. These are very\
  \ useful when there is have an important resource in a subscription that users should\
  \ not be able to delete or change and can help prevent accidental and malicious\
  \ changes or deletion."
