name: 3.7 Ensure CloudTrail logs are encrypted at rest using KMS CMKs - Level 2 (Automated)
description: "AWS CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for an account\
  \ and makes those logs available to users and resources in accordance with IAM policies.\
  \ AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is a managed service that helps create and control\
  \ the encryption keys used to encrypt account data, and uses Hardware Security Modules\
  \ (HSMs) to protect the security of encryption keys. CloudTrail logs can be configured\
  \ to leverage server side encryption (SSE) and KMS customer created master keys\
  \ (CMK) to further protect CloudTrail logs. It is recommended that CloudTrail be\
  \ configured to use SSE-KMS."
