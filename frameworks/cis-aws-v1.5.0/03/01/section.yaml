description: "AWS CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your\
  \ account and delivers log files to you. The recorded information includes the identity\
  \ of the API caller, the time of the API call, the source IP address of the API\
  \ caller, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the AWS\
  \ service. CloudTrail provides a history of AWS API calls for an account, including\
  \ API calls made via the Management Console, SDKs, command line tools, and higher-level\
  \ AWS services (such as CloudFormation)."
