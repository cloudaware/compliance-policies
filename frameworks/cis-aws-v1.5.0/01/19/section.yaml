name: 1.19 Ensure that all the expired SSL/TLS certificates stored in AWS IAM are
  removed - Level 1 (Automated)
description: "To enable HTTPS connections to your website or application in AWS, you\
  \ need an SSL/TLS server certificate. You can use ACM or IAM to store and deploy\
  \ server certificates. \nUse IAM as a certificate manager only when you must support\
  \ HTTPS connections in a region that is not supported by ACM. IAM securely encrypts\
  \ your private keys and stores the encrypted version in IAM SSL certificate storage.\
  \ IAM supports deploying server certificates in all regions, but you must obtain\
  \ your certificate from an external provider for use with AWS. You cannot upload\
  \ an ACM certificate to IAM. Additionally, you cannot manage your certificates from\
  \ the IAM Console."
