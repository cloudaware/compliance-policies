name: "7.7 Ensure that VHD's are Encrypted - Level 2 (Manual | Not supported, requires\
  \ a manual assessment)"
description: "VHD (Virtual Hard Disks) are stored in BLOB storage and are the old\
  \ style disks that were attached to Virtual Machines, and the BLOB VHD was then\
  \ leased to the VM. By Default storage accounts are not encrypted, and Azure Defender(Security\
  \ Centre) would then recommend that the OS disks should be encrypted. Storage accounts\
  \ can be encrypted as a whole using PMK or CMK and this should be turned on for\
  \ storage accounts containing VHD's."
