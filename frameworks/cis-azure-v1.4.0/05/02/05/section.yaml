  Group (Network Security Group Rule) - Level 1 (Automated)
description: |-
  Create an activity log alert for the Create or Update Network Security Group Rule event.
  Note: The recommendation name is reflected in the original name from the CIS Azure v1.4.0 official benchmark. The original name contains a mistake for not mentioning that this recommendation checks the "Security Group Rule event". We added the suffix "(Network Security Group Rule)" to emphasize the actual purpose of the test.
