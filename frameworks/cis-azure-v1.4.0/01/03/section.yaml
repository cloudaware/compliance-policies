name: 1.3 Ensure guest users are reviewed on a monthly basis - Level 1 (Manual | Assessment
  requires a manual procedure. Hover over the title for the full description)
description: "This recommendation assessment can be achieved only by a manual process\
  \ using the cloud configuration rule 'Azure Active Directory should not include\
  \ guest users' (IAM-044). This rule provides visibility to Guest users. Azure AD\
  \ is extended to include Azure AD B2B collaboration, allowing you to invite people\
  \ from outside your organization to be guest users in your cloud account and sign\
  \ in with their work, school, or social identities. Guest users allow you to share\
  \ your company's applications and services with users from any other organization\
  \ while maintaining control over your corporate data. Work with external partners,\
  \ large or small, even if they don't have Azure AD or an IT department. A simple\
  \ invitation and redemption process lets partners use their credentials to access\
  \ your company's resources as a guest user. Guest users should be reviewed on a\
  \ monthly basis to ensure that inactive and unneeded accounts are removed."
