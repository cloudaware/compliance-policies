name: 3.17 Ensure that `Allow Blob Anonymous Access` is set to `Disabled` - Level
  1 (Automated)
description: "The Azure Storage setting Allow Blob Anonymous Access (aka \"allowBlobPublicAccess\"\
  ) controls whether anonymous access is allowed for blob data in a storage account.\
  \ When this property is set to True, it enables public read access to blob data,\
  \ which can be convenient for sharing data but may carry security risks. When set\
  \ to False, it disallows public access to blob data, providing a more secure storage\
  \ environment."
