name: 3.16 Ensure 'Cross Tenant Replication' is not enabled - Level 1 (Automated)
description: "Cross Tenant Replication in Azure allows data to be replicated across\
  \ multiple Azure tenants. While this feature can be beneficial for data sharing\
  \ and availability, it also poses a significant security risk if not properly managed.\
  \ Unauthorized data access, data leakage, and compliance violations are potential\
  \ risks. Disabling Cross Tenant Replication ensures that data is not inadvertently\
  \ replicated across different tenant boundaries without explicit authorization."
