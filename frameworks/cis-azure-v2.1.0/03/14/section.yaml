name: "3.14 Ensure Storage Logging is Enabled for Table Service for 'Read', 'Write',\
  \ and 'Delete' Requests - Level 2 (Automated)"
description: "Azure Table storage is a service that stores structured NoSQL data in\
  \ the cloud, providing a key/attribute store with a schema-less design. Storage\
  \ Logging happens server-side and allows details for both successful and failed\
  \ requests to be recorded in the storage account. These logs allow users to see\
  \ the details of read, write, and delete operations against the tables. Storage\
  \ Logging log entries contain the following information about individual requests:\
  \ timing information such as start time, end-to-end latency, and server latency;\
  \ authentication details; concurrency information; and the sizes of the request\
  \ and response messages."
