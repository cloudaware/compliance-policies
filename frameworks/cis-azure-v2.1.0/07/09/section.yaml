name: 7.9 Ensure Trusted Launch is enabled on Virtual Machines - Level 1 (Automated)
description: "When **Secure Boot** and **vTPM** are enabled together, they provide\
  \ a strong foundation for protecting your VM from boot attacks. For example, if\
  \ an attacker attempts to replace the bootloader with a malicious version, Secure\
  \ Boot will prevent the VM from booting. If the attacker is able to bypass Secure\
  \ Boot and install a malicious bootloader, vTPM can be used to detect the intrusion\
  \ and alert you."
