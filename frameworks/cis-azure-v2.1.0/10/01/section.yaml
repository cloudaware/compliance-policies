name: 10.1 Ensure that Resource Locks are set for Mission-Critical Azure Resources
  - Level 2 (Manual)
description: "Resource Manager Locks provide a way for administrators to lock down\
  \ Azure resources to prevent deletion of, or modifications to, a resource. These\
  \ locks sit outside of the Role Based Access Controls (RBAC) hierarchy and, when\
  \ applied, will place restrictions on the resource for all users. These locks are\
  \ very useful when there is an important resource in a subscription that users should\
  \ not be able to delete or change. Locks can help prevent accidental and malicious\
  \ changes or deletion."
