  \ allowing you to invite people from outside your organization to be guest users\
  \ in your cloud account and sign in with their own work, school, or social identities.\
  \ Guest users allow you to share your company's applications and services with users\
  \ from any other organization, while maintaining control over your own corporate\
  \ data. \n\nWork with external partners, large or small, even if they don't have\
  \ Azure AD or an IT department. A simple invitation and redemption process lets\
  \ partners use their own credentials to access your company's resources as a guest\
  \ user.\n\nGuest users in every subscription should be review on a regular basis\
