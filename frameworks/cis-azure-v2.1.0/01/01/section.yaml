name: 1.1 Security Defaults
description: "**IMPORTANT:** The Azure \"Security Defaults\" recommendations represent\
  \ an entry-level set of recommendations which will be relevant to organizations\
  \ and tenants that are either just starting to use Azure, or are only utilizing\
  \ a bare minimum feature set such as the freely licensed tier of Microsoft Entra\
  \ ID. Security Defaults recommendations are intended to ensure that these entry-level\
  \ use cases are still capable of establishing a strong baseline of secure configuration.\
  \ \n\n**If your subscription is licensed to use Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2, it\
  \ is strongly recommended that the \"Security Defaults\" section (this section and\
  \ the recommendations therein) be bypassed in favor of the use of \"Conditional\
  \ Access.\"**"
