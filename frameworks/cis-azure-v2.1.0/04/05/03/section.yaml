name: 4.5.3 Use Entra ID Client Authentication and Azure RBAC where possible. - Level
  1 (Manual)
description: "Cosmos DB can use tokens or Entra ID for client authentication which\
  \ in turn will use Azure RBAC for authorization. Using Entra ID is significantly\
  \ more secure because Entra ID handles the credentials and allows for MFA and centralized\
  \ management, and the Azure RBAC better integrated with the rest of Azure."
