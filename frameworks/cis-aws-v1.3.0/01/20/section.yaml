name: 1.20 Ensure that S3 Buckets are configured with 'Block public access (bucket
  settings)'
description: "Amazon S3 provides 'Block public access (bucket settings)' and 'Block\
  \ public access (account settings)' to help you manage public access to Amazon S3\
  \ resources. By default, S3 buckets and objects are created with public access disabled.\
  \ However, an IAM principle with sufficient S3 permissions can enable public access\
  \ at the bucket and/or object level. While enabled, 'Block public access (bucket\
  \ settings)' prevents an individual bucket, and its contained objects, from becoming\
  \ publicly accessible. Similarly, 'Block public access (account settings)' prevents\
  \ all buckets, and contained objects, from becoming publicly accessible across the\
  \ entire account."
