name: 1.6 Ensure hardware MFA is enabled for the "root user" account
description: "The root user account is the most privileged user in an AWS account.\
  \ MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of a user name and password. With\
  \ MFA enabled, when a user signs in to an AWS website, they will be prompted for\
  \ their user name and password as well as for an authentication code from their\
  \ AWS MFA device. For Level 2, it is recommended that the root user account be protected\
  \ with a hardware MFA."
