name: 1.11 Do not setup access keys during initial user setup for all IAM users that
  have a console password
description: "AWS console defaults to no check boxes selected when creating a new\
  \ IAM user. When cerating the IAM User credentials you have to determine what type\
  \ of access they require. \n\nProgrammatic access: The IAM user might need to make\
  \ API calls, use the AWS CLI, or use the Tools for Windows PowerShell. In that case,\
  \ create an access key (access key ID and a secret access key) for that user. \n\
  \nAWS Management Console access: If the user needs to access the AWS Management\
  \ Console, create a password for the user."
