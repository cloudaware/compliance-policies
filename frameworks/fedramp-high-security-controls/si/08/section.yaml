  **SI-8 Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**
  
  **Guidance**: When CSO sends email on behalf of the government as part of the business
  offering, Control Description should include implementation of Domain-based Message
  Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) on the sending domain for outgoing
  messages as described in [DHS Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 18-01](https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/18-01/).
  
  **Guidance**: CSPs should confirm DMARC configuration (where appropriate) to ensure
  that policy=reject and the rua parameter includes reports@dmarc.cyber.dhs.gov.
  DMARC compliance should be documented in the SI-08 control implementation solution
  description and list the FROM: domain(s) that will be seen by email recipients.
