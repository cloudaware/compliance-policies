description: |-
  Identify an alternate processing site that is sufficiently separated from the primary processing
  site to reduce susceptibility to the same threats.

  **CP-7 (1) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**

  **Guidance**: The service provider may determine what is considered a sufficient degree of
  separation between the primary and alternate processing sites, based on the types of
  threats that are of concern. For one particular type of threat (i.e., hostile cyber attack),
  the degree of separation between sites will be less relevant.
