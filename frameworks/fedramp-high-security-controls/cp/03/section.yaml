    2. When required by system changes; and

    3. [FedRAMP Assignment: at least annually] thereafter; and
  
  b. Review and update contingency training content [FedRAMP Assignment: at least

  **CP-3 Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**
  
  **(a) Requirement**: Privileged admins and engineers must take the basic contingency
  training within ten (10) days. Consideration must be given for those privileged admins
  and engineers with critical contingency-related roles, to gain enough system context and
  situational awareness to understand the full impact of contingency training as it applies
  to their respective level. Newly hired critical contingency personnel must take this more
  in-depth training within sixty (60) days of hire date when the training will have more
  impact.
