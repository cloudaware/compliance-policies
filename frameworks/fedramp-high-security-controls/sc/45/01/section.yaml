name: "SC-45(1) Synchronization with Authoritative Time Source (M)(H)"
description: |-
  (a) Compare the internal system clocks [FedRAMP Assignment: At least hourly] with
  [FedRAMP Assignment: <http://tf.nist.gov/tf-cgi/servers.cgi>]; and

  (b) Synchronize the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source when the
  time difference is greater than [FedRAMP Assignment: any difference].
  
  **SC-45(1) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**
  
  **Guidance**: Synchronization of system clocks improves the accuracy of log
  analysis.
  
  **Requirement**: The service provider selects primary and secondary time servers
  used by the NIST Internet time service. The secondary server is selected from a
  different geographic region than the primary server.
  
  **Requirement**: The service provider synchronizes the system clocks of network
  computers that run operating systems other than Windows to the Windows Server
  Domain Controller emulator or to the same time source for that server.
