name: "SC-8 Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity (L)(M)(H)"
description: |-
  Protect the [FedRAMP Assignment: confidentiality AND integrity] of transmitted information.

  **SC-8 Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**
  
  **Guidance**: For each instance of data in transit, confidentiality AND integrity should be
  through cryptography as specified in SC-8 (1), physical means as specified in SC-8 (5),
  or in combination.
  
  For clarity, this control applies to all data in transit. Examples include the following data
  flows:

  - Crossing the system boundary

  - Between compute instances - including containers
  - From a compute instance to storage
  - Replication between availability zones
  - Transmission of backups to storage
  - From a load balancer to a compute instance
  - Flows from management tools required for their work - e.g. log collection,
  scanning, etc.

  The following applies only when choosing SC-8 (5) in lieu of SC-8 (1)
  
  FedRAMP-Defined Assignment / Selection Parameters
  
  SC-8 (5)-1 [a hardened or alarmed carrier Protective Distribution System (PDS) when
  outside of Controlled Access Area (CAA)]
  
  SC-8 (5)-2 [prevent unauthorized disclosure of information AND detect changes to
  information]
  
  **Guidance**: SC-8 (5) applies when physical protection has been selected as the method
  to protect confidentiality and integrity. For physical protection, data in transit must be in
  either a Controlled Access Area (CAA), or a Hardened or alarmed PDS.
  
  **Hardened or alarmed PDS**: Shall be as defined in SECTION X - CATEGORY 2 PDS
  INSTALLATION GUIDANCE of CNSSI No.7003, titled PROTECTED DISTRIBUTION
  SYSTEMS (PDS). Per the CNSSI No. 7003 Section VIII, PDS must originate and
  terminate in a Controlled Access Area (CAA).
  
  **Controlled Access Area (CAA)**: Data will be considered physically protected, and in a
  CAA if it meets Section 2.3 of the DHS's Recommended Practice: Improving Industrial
  Control System Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. CSPs can meet Section
  2.3 of the DHS' recommended practice by satisfactory implementation of the following
  controls PE-2 (1), PE-2 (2), PE-2 (3), PE-3 (2), PE-3 (3), PE-6 (2), and PE-6 (3). Note:
  When selecting SC-8 (5), the above SC-8(5), and the above referenced PE controls must
  be added to the SSP. CNSSI No.7003 can be accessed here:
