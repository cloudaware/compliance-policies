name: "SC-8(1) Cryptographic Protection (L)(M)(H)"
description: |-
  Implement cryptographic mechanisms to [FedRAMP Assignment: prevent unauthorized
  disclosure of information AND detect changes to information] during transmission.

  **SC-8 (1) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**
  
  **Guidance**: See M-22-09, including "Agencies encrypt all DNS requests and HTTP traffic
  within their environment"SC-8 (1) applies when encryption has been selected as the
  method to protect confidentiality and integrity. Otherwise refer to SC-8 (5). SC-8 (1) is
  strongly encouraged.
  
  **Guidance**: Note that this enhancement requires the use of cryptography which must be
  compliant with Federal requirements and utilize FIPS validated or NSA approved
  cryptography (see SC-13).
  
  **Guidance**: When leveraging encryption from the underlying IaaS/PaaS: While some
  IaaS/PaaS services provide encryption by default, many require encryption to be
  configured, and enabled by the customer. The CSP has the responsibility to verify
  encryption is properly configured.
  
  **Requirement**: Please ensure SSP Section 10.3 Cryptographic Modules Implemented for
  Data At Rest (DAR) and Data In Transit (DIT) is fully populated for reference in this
  control.
