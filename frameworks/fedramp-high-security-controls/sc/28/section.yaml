description: |-
  Protect the [FedRAMP Assignment: confidentiality AND integrity] of the following information at
  rest: [Assignment: organization-defined information at rest].

  **SC-28 Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**
  
  **Guidance**: The organization supports the capability to use cryptographic mechanisms to
  protect information at rest.
  
  **Guidance**: When leveraging encryption from underlying IaaS/PaaS: While some
  IaaS/PaaS services provide encryption by default, many require encryption to be
  configured, and enabled by the customer. The CSP has the responsibility to verify
  encryption is properly configured.
  
  **Guidance**: Note that this enhancement requires the use of cryptography in accordance
  with SC-13.
