description: |-
  Request and perform data origin authentication and data integrity verification on the
  name/address resolution responses the system receives from authoritative sources.

  **SC-21 Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**
  
  **Guidance**: Accepting an unsigned reply is acceptable
  
  **Guidance**: SC-21 applies to use of internal recursive DNS to access a domain outside
  the boundary by a component inside the boundary. DNSSEC resolution to access a
  component inside the boundary is excluded.
  
  **Requirement**: Control description should include how DNSSEC is implemented on
  recursive DNS servers to make DNSSEC requests when resolving DNS requests from
  internal components to domains external to the CSO boundary.
  
  - If the reply is signed, and fails DNSSEC, do not use the reply.
  - If the reply is unsigned:
    - CSP chooses the policy to apply.
  
  **Requirement**: Internal recursive DNS servers must be located inside an authorized
  environment. It is typically within the boundary or leveraged from an underlying
  IaaS/PaaS.
