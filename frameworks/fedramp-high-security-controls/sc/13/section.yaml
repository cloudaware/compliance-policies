name: "SC-13 Cryptographic Protection (L)(M)(H)"
description: |-
  a. Determine the [Assignment: organization-defined cryptographic uses]; and

  b. Implement the following types of cryptography required for each specified cryptographic
  use: [FedRAMP Assignment: FIPS-validated or NSA-approved cryptography].
  
  **SC-13 Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**
  
  **Guidance**: This control applies to all use of cryptography. In addition to encryption, this
  includes functions such as hashing, random number generation, and key generation.
  
  Examples include the following:
  - Encryption of data
  - Decryption of data
  - Generation of one time passwords (OTPs) for MFA
  - Protocols such as TLS, SSH, and HTTPS

  The requirement for FIPS 140 validation, as well as timelines for acceptance of FIPS
  140-2, and 140-3 can be found at the [NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program
  (CMVP)](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program).

  **Guidance**: For NSA-approved cryptography, the National Information Assurance
  Partnership (NIAP) oversees a national program to evaluate Commercial IT Products for
  Use in National Security Systems. The NIAP Product Compliant List can be found at the
  following location: <https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Product/index.cfm>

  **Guidance**:Guidance**: When leveraging encryption from underlying IaaS/PaaS: While some
  IaaS/PaaS provide encryption by default, many require encryption to be configured, and
  enabled by the customer. The CSP has the responsibility to verify encryption is properly
  configured.

  **Guidance**: Moving to non-FIPS CM or product is acceptable when:

  - FIPS validated version has a known vulnerability

  - Feature with vulnerability is in use
  - Non-FIPS version fixes the vulnerability
  - Non-FIPS version is submitted to NIST for FIPS validation
  - POA&M is added to track approval, and deployment when ready

  **Guidance**: At a minimum, this control applies to cryptography in use for the following
  controls: AU-9(3), CP-9(8), IA-2(6), IA-5(1), MP-5, SC-8(1), and SC-28(1).
