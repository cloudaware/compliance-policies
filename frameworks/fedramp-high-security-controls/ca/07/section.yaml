  **CA-7 Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**
  
  **Guidance**: FedRAMP does not provide a template for the Continuous Monitoring Plan.
  CSPs should reference the FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring Strategy Guide when
  developing the Continuous Monitoring Plan.
  
  **Requirement**: Operating System, Database, Web Application, Container, and Service
  Configuration Scans: at least monthly. All scans performed by Independent Assessor: at
  least annually.

  **Requirement**: CSOs with more than one agency ATO must implement a collaborative
  Continuous Monitoring (Con Mon) approach described in the FedRAMP Guide for
  Multi-Agency Continuous Monitoring. This requirement applies to CSOs authorized via
  the Agency path as each agency customer is responsible for performing Con Mon
  oversight. It does not apply to CSPs authorized via the JAB path because the JAB
  performs Con Mon oversight.
