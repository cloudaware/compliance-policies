description: |-
  Develop, document, and implement a configuration management plan for the system that:

  a. Addresses roles, responsibilities, and configuration management processes and
  procedures;

  b. Establishes a process for identifying configuration items throughout the system
  development life cycle and for managing the configuration of the configuration items;

  c. Defines the configuration items for the system and places the configuration items under
  configuration management;

  d. Is reviewed and approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]; and

  e. Protects the configuration management plan from unauthorized disclosure and
  modification.

  **CM-9 Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**

  **Guidance**: FedRAMP does not provide a template for the Configuration Management
  Plan. However, NIST SP 800-128, Guide for Security-Focused Configuration
  Management of Information Systems, provides guidelines for the implementation of CM
  controls as well as a sample CMP outline in Appendix D of the Guide.
