name: 7.3 Ensure That a Default Customer-Managed Encryption Key (CMEK) Is Specified
  for All BigQuery Data Sets - Level 2 (Manual)
description: "BigQuery by default encrypts the data as rest by employing `Envelope\
  \ Encryption` using Google managed cryptographic keys. The data is encrypted using\
  \ the `data encryption keys` and data encryption keys themselves are further encrypted\
  \ using `key encryption keys`. This is seamless and do not require any additional\
  \ input from the user. However, if you want to have greater control, Customer-managed\
  \ encryption keys (CMEK) can be used as encryption key management solution for BigQuery\
  \ Data Sets."
