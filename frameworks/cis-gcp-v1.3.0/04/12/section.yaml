name: 4.12 Ensure the Latest Operating System Updates Are Installed On Your Virtual
  Machines in All Projects - Level 2 (Manual)
description: "For the virtual machines where you manage the operating system in Infrastructure\
  \ as a Service (IaaS), you are responsible for keeping these operating systems and\
  \ programs up to date. There are multiple ways to manage updates yourself that would\
  \ be difficult to fit into one recommendation. Check the CIS Benchmarks for each\
  \ of your Operating Systems as well for potential solutions there. In this recommendation\
  \ we will use a feature in Google Cloud via its VM manager API to manage updates\
  \ called Operating System Patch Management (referred to OS Patch Management from\
  \ here on out). This may requires installing the OS Config API if it is not already\
  \ installed. Also if you install custom operating systems, they may not functionally\
  \ support the local OS config agent required to gather operating system patch information\
  \ and issue update commands. These update commands are the default Linux and Windows\
  \ commands to install updates such as yum or apt. This feature allows for a central\
  \ management to issue those commands. OS Patch management also does not host the\
  \ updates itself, so your VMs will need to be public or be able to access the internet.\
  \ This is not the only Patch Management solution available to your organization\
  \ and you should weigh your needs before committing to using this."
