name: 1.17 Ensure that Dataproc Cluster is encrypted using Customer-Managed Encryption
  Key - Level 2 (Automated)
description: "When you use Dataproc, cluster and job data is stored on Persistent\
  \ Disks (PDs) associated with the Compute Engine VMs in your cluster and in a Cloud\
  \ Storage staging bucket. This PD and bucket data is encrypted using a Google-generated\
  \ data encryption key (DEK) and key encryption key (KEK). The CMEK feature allows\
  \ you to create, use, and revoke the key encryption key (KEK). Google still controls\
  \ the data encryption key (DEK)."
