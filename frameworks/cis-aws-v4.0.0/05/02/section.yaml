name: 5.2 Ensure no Network ACLs allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to remote server administration ports (Automated)
description: >
  The Network Access Control List (NACL) function provides stateless filtering of ingress
  and egress network traffic to AWS resources. It is recommended that no NACL allows
  unrestricted ingress access to remote server administration ports, such as SSH on port
  22 and RDP on port 3389, using either the TCP (6), UDP (17), or ALL (-1) protocols.
