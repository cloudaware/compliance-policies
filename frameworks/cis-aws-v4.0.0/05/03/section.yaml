name: 5.3 Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to remote server administration ports (Automated)
description: >
  Security groups provide stateful filtering of ingress and egress network traffic to AWS
  resources. It is recommended that no security group allows unrestricted ingress access
  to remote server administration ports, such as SSH on port 22 and RDP on port 3389,
  using either the TCP (6), UDP (17), or ALL (-1) protocols.
