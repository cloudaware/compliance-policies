name: 5.6 Ensure routing tables for VPC peering are "least access" (Manual)
description: >
  Once a VPC peering connection is established, routing tables must be updated to
  enable any connections between the peered VPCs. These routes can be as specific as
  desired, even allowing for the peering of a VPC to only a single host on the other side of
  the connection.
