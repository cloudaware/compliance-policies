name: 2.2.1 Ensure that encryption-at-rest is enabled for RDS instances (Automated)
description: >
  Amazon RDS encrypted DB instances use the industry-standard AES-256 encryption
  algorithm to encrypt your data on the server that hosts your Amazon RDS DB instances.
  After your data is encrypted, Amazon RDS handles the authentication of access and the
  decryption of your data transparently, with minimal impact on performance.
