name: 2.2.3 Ensure that RDS instances are not publicly accessible (Automated)
description: >
  Ensure and verify that the RDS database instances provisioned in your AWS account
  restrict unauthorized access in order to minimize security risks. To restrict access to any
  RDS database instance, you must disable the Publicly Accessible flag for the database
  and update the VPC security group associated with the instance.
