name: 2.1.4 Ensure that S3 is configured with 'Block Public Access' enabled (Automated)
description: >
  Amazon S3 provides `Block public access (bucket settings)` and `Block public
  access (account settings)` to help you manage public access to Amazon S3
  resources. By default, S3 buckets and objects are created with public access disabled.
  However, an IAM principal with sufficient S3 permissions can enable public access at
  the bucket and/or object level. While enabled, `Block public access (bucket
  settings)` prevents an individual bucket and its contained objects from becoming
  publicly accessible. Similarly, `Block public access (account settings)` prevents
  all buckets and their contained objects from becoming publicly accessible across the entire account.
