name: 4.3 Ensure usage of the 'root' account is monitored (Manual)
description: |-
  Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to
  CloudWatch Logs or an external Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
  environment, and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms.

  It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for 'root' login attempts
  to detect unauthorized use or attempts to use the root account.
