name: 4.12 Ensure changes to network gateways are monitored (Manual)
description: |-
  Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to
  CloudWatch Logs or an external Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
  environment, and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms.

  Network gateways are required to send and receive traffic to a destination outside of a
  VPC. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for changes to
  network gateways.
