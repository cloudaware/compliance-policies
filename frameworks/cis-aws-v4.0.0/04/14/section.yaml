name: 4.14 Ensure VPC changes are monitored (Manual)
description: |-
  Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to
  CloudWatch Logs or an external Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
  environment, and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms.

  It is possible to have more than one VPC within an account; additionally, it is also
  possible to create a peer connection between two VPCs, enabling network traffic to
  route between them.

  It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for changes made to
  VPCs.
