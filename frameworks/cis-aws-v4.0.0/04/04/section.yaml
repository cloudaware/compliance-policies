name: 4.4 Ensure IAM policy changes are monitored (Manual)
description: |-
  Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to
  CloudWatch Logs or an external Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
  environment, and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms.

  It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for changes made to
  Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.
