name: 4.10 Ensure security group changes are monitored (Manual)
description: |-
  Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to
  CloudWatch Logs or an external Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
  environment, and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms.

  Security groups are stateful packet filters that control ingress and egress traffic within a
  VPC.

  It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established to detect changes to
  security groups.
