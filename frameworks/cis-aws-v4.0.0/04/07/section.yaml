name: 4.7 Ensure disabling or scheduled deletion of customer created CMKs is monitored (Manual)
description: |-
  Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to
  CloudWatch Logs or an external Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
  environment, and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms.

  It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for customer-created
  CMKs that have changed state to disabled or are scheduled for deletion.
