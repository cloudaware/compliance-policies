name: 4.16 Ensure AWS Security Hub is enabled (Automated)
description: |-
  Security Hub collects security data from various AWS accounts, services, and
  supported third-party partner products, helping you analyze your security trends and
  identify the highest-priority security issues. When you enable Security Hub, it begins to
  consume, aggregate, organize, and prioritize findings from the AWS services that you
  have enabled, such as Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, and Amazon Macie.
  You can also enable integrations with AWS partner security products.
