name: 4.11 Ensure Network Access Control List (NACL) changes are monitored (Manual)
description: |-
  Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to
  CloudWatch Logs or an external Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
  environment, and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms.

  NACLs are used as a stateless packet filter to control ingress and egress traffic for
  subnets within a VPC. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established
  for any changes made to NACLs.
