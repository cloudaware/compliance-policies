name: 4.13 Ensure route table changes are monitored (Manual)
description: |-
  Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to
  CloudWatch Logs or an external Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
  environment, and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms.

  Routing tables are used to route network traffic between subnets and to network
  gateways.

  It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for changes to route
  tables.
