name: 4.2 Ensure management console sign-in without MFA is monitored (Manual)
description: |-
  Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to
  CloudWatch Logs or an external Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
  environment, and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms.

  It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for console logins that
  are not protected by multi-factor authentication (MFA).
