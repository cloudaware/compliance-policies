name: 1.15 Ensure IAM users receive permissions only through groups (Automated)
description: |-
  IAM users are granted access to services, functions, and data through IAM policies.
  There are four ways to define policies for a user: 1) Edit the user policy directly, also
  known as an inline or user policy; 2) attach a policy directly to a user; 3) add the user to
  an IAM group that has an attached policy; 4) add the user to an IAM group that has an inline policy.
  
  Only the third implementation is recommended.
