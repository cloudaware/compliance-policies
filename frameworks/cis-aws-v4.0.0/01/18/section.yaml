name: 1.18 Ensure IAM instance roles are used for AWS resource access from instances (Automated)
description: >
  AWS access from within AWS instances can be done by either encoding AWS keys into
  AWS API calls or by assigning the instance to a role which has an appropriate
  permissions policy for the required access. "AWS Access" means accessing the APIs of
  AWS in order to access AWS resources or manage AWS account resources.
