name: 1.20 Ensure that IAM Access Analyzer is enabled for all regions (Automated)
description: |-
  Enable the IAM Access Analyzer for IAM policies regarding all resources in each active
  AWS region.
  
  IAM Access Analyzer is a technology introduced at AWS reinvent 2019. After the
  Analyzer is enabled in IAM, scan results are displayed on the console showing the
  accessible resources. Scans show resources that other accounts and federated users
  can access, such as KMS keys and IAM roles. The results allow you to determine
  whether an unintended user is permitted, making it easier for administrators to monitor
  least privilege access. Access Analyzer analyzes only the policies that are applied to
  resources in the same AWS Region.
