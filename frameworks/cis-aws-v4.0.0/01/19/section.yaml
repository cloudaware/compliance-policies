name: 1.19 Ensure that all expired SSL/TLS certificates stored in AWS IAM are removed (Automated)
description: >
  To enable HTTPS connections to your website or application in AWS, you need an SSL/TLS server certificate. 
  You can use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) or IAM to store and deploy server certificates. Use IAM as a 
  certificate manager only when you must support HTTPS connections in a region that is not supported by ACM. 
  IAM securely encrypts your private keys and stores the encrypted version in IAM SSL certificate storage. 
  IAM supports deploying server certificates in all regions, but you must obtain your certificate from 
  an external provider for use with AWS. You cannot upload an ACM certificate to IAM. Additionally, 
  you cannot manage your certificates from the IAM Console.
