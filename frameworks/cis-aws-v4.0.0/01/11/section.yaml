name: 1.11 Do not create access keys during initial setup for IAM users with a console password (Manual)
description: |-
  AWS console defaults to no check boxes selected when creating a new IAM user.
  When creating the IAM User credentials you have to determine what type of access
  they require.

  Programmatic access: The IAM user might need to make API calls, use the AWS CLI,
  or use the Tools for Windows PowerShell. In that case, create an access key (access
  key ID and a secret access key) for that user.
  
  AWS Management Console access: If the user needs to access the AWS Management
  Console, create a password for the user.
