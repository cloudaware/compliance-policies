name: 1.22 Ensure access to AWSCloudShellFullAccess is restricted (Manual)
description: >
  AWS CloudShell is a convenient way of running CLI commands against AWS services;
  a managed IAM policy ('AWSCloudShellFullAccess') provides full access to CloudShell,
  which allows file upload and download capability between a user's local system and the
  CloudShell environment. Within the CloudShell environment, a user has sudo
  permissions and can access the internet. Therefore, it is feasible to install file transfer
  software, for example, and move data from CloudShell to external internet servers.
