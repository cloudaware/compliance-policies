name: 3.9 Ensure that object-level logging for read events is enabled for S3 buckets (Automated)
description: >
  S3 object-level API operations, such as GetObject, DeleteObject, and PutObject, are
  referred to as data events. By default, CloudTrail trails do not log data events, so it is
  recommended to enable object-level logging for S3 buckets.
