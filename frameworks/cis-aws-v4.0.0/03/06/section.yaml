name: 3.6 Ensure rotation for customer-created symmetric CMKs is enabled (Automated)
description: >
  AWS Key Management Service (KMS) allows customers to rotate the backing key,
  which is key material stored within the KMS that is tied to the key ID of the customer-created
  customer master key (CMK). The backing key is used to perform cryptographic
  operations such as encryption and decryption. Automated key rotation currently retains
  all prior backing keys so that decryption of encrypted data can occur transparently. It is
  recommended that CMK key rotation be enabled for symmetric keys. Key rotation
  cannot be enabled for any asymmetric CMK.
