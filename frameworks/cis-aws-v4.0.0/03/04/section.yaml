name: 3.4 Ensure that server access logging is enabled on the CloudTrail S3 bucket (Automated)
description: >
  Server access logging generates a log that contains access records for each request
  made to your S3 bucket. An access log record contains details about the request, such
  as the request type, the resources specified in the request worked, and the time and
  date the request was processed. It is recommended that server access logging be enabled 
  on the CloudTrail S3 bucket.
