name: "6.2.5 Ensure 'log_duration' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance\
  \ is set to 'on' - Level 1 (Manual | Not supported, requires a manual assessment)"
description: Enabling the `log_duration` setting causes the duration of each completed
  statement to be logged. This does not logs the text of the query and thus behaves
  different from the `log_min_duration_statement` flag. This parameter cannot be changed
  after session start.
