name: 6.2.15 Ensure that the 'log_temp_files' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL
  instance is set to '0' (on) - Level 1 (Automated)
description: "PostgreSQL can create a temporary file for actions such as sorting,\
  \ hashing and temporary query results when these operations exceed `work_mem`. The\
  \ `log_temp_files` flag controls logging names and the file size when it is deleted.\
  \ \nConfiguring `log_temp_files` to `0` causes all temporary file information to\
  \ be logged, while positive values log only files whose size is greater than or\
  \ equal to the specified number of kilobytes. A value of `-1` disables temporary\
  \ file information logging."
