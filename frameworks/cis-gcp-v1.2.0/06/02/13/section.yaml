name: 6.2.13 Ensure that the 'log_min_messages' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL
  instance is set appropriately - Level 1 (Manual)
description: |-
  The `log_min_messages` flag defines the minimum message severity level that is considered as an error statement. Messages for error statements are logged with the SQL statement. Valid values include `DEBUG5`, `DEBUG4`, `DEBUG3`, `DEBUG2`, `DEBUG1`, `INFO`, `NOTICE`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `LOG`, `FATAL`, and `PANIC`.
  Each severity level includes the subsequent levels mentioned above.

  Note: To effectively turn off logging failing statements, set this parameter to PANIC.

  ERROR is considered the best practice setting. Changes should only be made in accordance with the organization's logging policy.
