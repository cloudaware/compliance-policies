name: 6.2.10 Ensure 'log_planner_stats' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance
  is set to 'off' - Level 2 (Automated)
description: The same SQL query can be excuted in multiple ways and still produce
  different results. The PostgreSQL planner/optimizer is responsible to create an
  optimal execution plan for each query. The `log_planner_stats` flag controls the
  inclusion of PostgreSQL planner performance statistics in the PostgreSQL logs for
  each query. Will be supported in the near future.
