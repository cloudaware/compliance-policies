name: 6.2.11 Ensure 'log_executor_stats' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance
  is set to 'off' - Level 2 (Automated)
description: The PostgreSQL executor is responsible to execute the plan handed over
  by the PostgreSQL planner. The executor processes the plan recursively to extract
  the required set of rows. The `log_executor_stats` flag controls the inclusion of
  PostgreSQL executor performance statistics in the PostgreSQL logs for each query.
  Will be supported in the near future.
