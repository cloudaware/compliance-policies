name: 6.2.8 Ensure 'log_hostname' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance
  is set appropriately - Level 1 (Automated | Roadmapped)
description: PostgreSQL logs only the IP address of the connecting hosts. The `log_hostname`
  flag controls the logging of `hostnames` in addition to the IP addresses logged.
  The performance hit is dependent on the configuration of the environment and the
  host name resolution setup. This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf`
  file or on the server command line. Will be supported in the near future.
