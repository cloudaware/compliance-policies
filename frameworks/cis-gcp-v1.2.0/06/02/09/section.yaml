name: 6.2.9 Ensure 'log_parser_stats' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance
  is set to 'off' - Level 2 (Automated)
description: The PostgreSQL planner/optimizer is responsible to parse and verify the
  syntax of each query received by the server. If the syntax is correct a `parse tree`
  is built up else an error is generated. The `log_parser_stats` flag controls the
  inclusion of parser performance statistics in the PostgreSQL logs for each query.
  Will be supported in the near future.
