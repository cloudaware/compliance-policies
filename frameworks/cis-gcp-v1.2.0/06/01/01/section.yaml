name: 6.1.1 Ensure that a MySQL database instance does not allow anyone to connect
  with administrative privileges - Level 1 (Automated | Roadmapped)
description: |-
  It is recommended to set a password for the administrative user (`root` by default) to prevent unauthorized access to the SQL database instances.

  This recommendation is applicable only for MySQL Instances. PostgreSQL does not offer any setting for No Password from the cloud console. Will be supported in the near future.
