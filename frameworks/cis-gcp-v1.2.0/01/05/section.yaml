name: 1.5 Ensure that Service Account has no Admin privileges - Level 1 (Automated)
description: "A service account is a special Google account that belongs to an application\
  \ or a VM, instead of to an individual end-user. The application uses the service\
  \ account to call the service's Google API so that users aren't directly involved.\
  \ It's recommended not to use admin access for ServiceAccount."
