description: |-
  a. [Selection (one-or-more): Establish [Assignment: organization-defined terms and
  conditions]; Identify [Assignment: organization-defined controls asserted to be
  implemented on external systems]], consistent with the trust relationships established
  with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external systems,
  allowing authorized individuals to:

    1. Access the system from external systems; and
    2. Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external
    systems; or

  b. Prohibit the use of [Assignment: organizationally-defined types of external systems].

  **AC-20 Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**
  
  **Guidance**: The interrelated controls of AC-20, CA-3, and SA-9 should be differentiated
  as follows:

  - AC-20 describes system access to and from external systems.

  - CA-3 describes documentation of an agreement between the respective system owners
  when data is exchanged between the CSO and an external system.

  - SA-9 describes the responsibilities of external system owners. These responsibilities
  would typically be captured in the agreement required by CA-3.
