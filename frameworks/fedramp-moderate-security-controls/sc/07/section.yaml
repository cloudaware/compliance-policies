description: |-
  a. Monitor and control communications at the external managed interfaces to the system
  and at key internal managed interfaces within the system;

  b. Implement subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are [Selection:
  Assignment: physically; logically] separated from internal organizational networks; and
  
  c. Connect to external networks or systems only through managed interfaces consisting of
  boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational security and
  privacy architecture.
  
  **SC-7 Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**
  
  **(b) Guidance**: SC-7 (b) should be met by subnet isolation. A subnetwork (subnet) is a
  physically or logically segmented section of a larger network defined at TCP/IP Layer 3,
  to both minimize traffic and, important for a FedRAMP Authorization, add a crucial layer
  of network isolation. Subnets are distinct from VLANs (Layer 2), security groups, and
  VPCs and are specifically required to satisfy SC-7 part b and other controls. See the
  [FedRAMP Subnets White Paper]
  (<https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_subnets_white_paper.pdf>) for additional information.
