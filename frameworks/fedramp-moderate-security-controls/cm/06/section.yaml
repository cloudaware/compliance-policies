name: "CM-6 Configuration Settings (L)(M)(H)"
description: |-
  a. Establish and document configuration settings for components employed within the
  system that reflect the most restrictive mode consistent with operational requirements
  using [Assignment: organization-defined common secure configurations];
  
  b. Implement the configuration settings;
  
  c. Identify, document, and approve any deviations from established configuration settings
  for [Assignment: organization-defined system components] based on [Assignment:
  organization-defined operational requirements]; and
  
  d. Monitor and control changes to the configuration settings in accordance with
  organizational policies and procedures.
  
  **CM-6 Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**
  
  **Guidance**: Compliance checks are used to evaluate configuration settings and provide
  general insight into the overall effectiveness of configuration management activities.
  CSPs and 3PAOs typically combine compliance check findings into a single CM-6
  finding, which is acceptable. However, for initial assessments, annual assessments, and
  significant change requests, FedRAMP requires a clear understanding, on a per-control
  basis, where risks exist. Therefore, 3PAOs must also analyze compliance check findings
  as part of the controls assessment. Where a direct mapping exists, the 3PAO must
  document additional findings per control in the corresponding SAR Risk Exposure Table
  (RET), which are then documented in the CSP's Plan of Action and Milestones
  (POA&M). This will likely result in the details of individual control findings overlapping
  with those in the combined CM-6 finding, which is acceptable.
  
  During monthly continuous monitoring, new findings from CSP compliance checks may
  be combined into a single CM-6 POA&M item. CSPs are not required to map the
  findings to specific controls because controls are only assessed during initial
  assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests.
  
  **(a) Requirement 1**: The service provider shall use the DoD STIGs to establish
  configuration settings; Center for Internet Security up to Level 2 (CIS Level 2) guidelines
  shall be used if STIGs are not available; Custom baselines shall be used if CIS is not
  available.
  
  **(a) Requirement 2**: The service provider shall ensure that checklists for configuration
  settings are Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) validated or SCAP
  compatible (if validated checklists are not available).
