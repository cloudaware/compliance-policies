name: "IA-5(1) Password-based Authentication (L)(M)(H)"
description: |-
  For password-based authentication:

  (a) Maintain a list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords and
  update the list [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and when
  organizational passwords are suspected to have been compromised directly or
  indirectly;
  
  (b) Verify, when users create or update passwords, that the passwords are not found
  on the list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords in IA-5(1)(a);
  
  (c) Transmit passwords only over cryptographically-protected channels;
  
  (d) Store passwords using an approved salted key derivation function, preferably
  using a keyed hash;
  
  (e) Require immediate selection of a new password upon account recovery;
  
  (f) Allow user selection of long passwords and passphrases, including spaces and all
  printable characters;
  
  (g) Employ automated tools to assist the user in selecting strong password
  authenticators; and
  
  (h) Enforce the following composition and complexity rules: [Assignment:
  organization-defined composition and complexity rules].
  
  **IA-5 (1) Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**
  
  **Guidance**: Note that (c) and (d) require the use of cryptography which must be
  compliant with Federal requirements and utilize FIPS validated or NSA approved
  cryptography (see SC-13).
  
  **Requirement**: Password policies must be compliant with NIST SP 800-63B for all
  memorized, lookup, out-of-band, or One-Time-Passwords (OTP). Password
  policies shall not enforce special character or minimum password rotation
  requirements for memorized secrets of users.
  
  **(h) Requirement**: For cases where technology doesnâ€™t allow multi-factor
  authentication, these rules should be enforced: must have a minimum length of 14
  characters and must support all printable ASCII characters.
  
  For emergency use accounts, these rules should be enforced: must have a
  minimum length of 14 characters, must support all printable ASCII characters, and
  passwords must be changed if used.
