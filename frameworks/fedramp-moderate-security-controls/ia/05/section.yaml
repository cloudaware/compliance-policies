description: |-
  Manage system authenticators by:

  a. Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity of the individual,
  group, role, service, or device receiving the authenticator;
  
  b. Establishing initial authenticator content for any authenticators issued by the
  organization;
  
  c. Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended
  use;
  
  d. Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator
  distribution, for lost or compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking
  authenticators;
  
  e. Changing default authenticators prior to first use;
  
  f. Changing or refreshing authenticators [Assignment: organization-defined time period by
  authenticator type] or when [Assignment: organization-defined events] occur;
  
  g. Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification;
  
  h. Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific controls to protect
  authenticators; and
  
  i. Changing authenticators for group or role accounts when membership to those accounts
  changes.
  
  **IA-5 Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**
  
  **Guidance**: SP 800-63C Section 6.2.3 Encrypted Assertion requires that authentication
  assertions be encrypted when passed through third parties, such as a browser. For
  example, a SAML assertion can be encrypted using XML-Encryption, or an OpenID
  Connect ID Token can be encrypted using JSON Web Encryption (JWE).
  
  **Requirement**: Authenticators must be compliant with NIST SP 800-63-3 Digital Identity
  Guidelines IAL, AAL, FAL level 2. Link <https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3>.
