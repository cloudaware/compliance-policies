name: "RA-5 Vulnerability Monitoring and Scanning (L)(M)(H)"
description: |-
  a. Monitor and scan for vulnerabilities in the system and hosted applications [FedRAMP
  Assignment: monthly operating system/infrastructure; monthly web applications
  (including APIs) and databases] and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the
  system are identified and reported;

  b. Employ vulnerability monitoring tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among
  tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards
  for:
  
    1. Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;
    
    2. Formatting checklists and test procedures; and
    
    3. Measuring vulnerability impact;
  
  c. Analyze vulnerability scan reports and results from vulnerability monitoring;
  
  d. Remediate legitimate vulnerabilities [FedRAMP Assignment: high-risk vulnerabilities
  mitigated within thirty (30) days from date of discovery; moderate-risk vulnerabilities
  mitigated within ninety (90) days from date of discovery; low risk vulnerabilities mitigated
  within one hundred and eighty (180) days from date of discovery] in accordance with an
  organizational assessment of risk;
  
  e. Share information obtained from the vulnerability monitoring process and control
  assessments with [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to help
  eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other systems; and
  
  f. Employ vulnerability monitoring tools that include the capability to readily update the
  vulnerabilities to be scanned.
  
  **RA-5 Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:**
  
  **Guidance**: See the FedRAMP Documents page > Vulnerability Scanning Requirements
  <https://www.FedRAMP.gov/documents/>

  **Guidance**: Informational findings from a scanner are detailed as a returned result that
  holds no vulnerability risk or severity and for FedRAMP does not require an entry onto
  the POA&M or entry onto the RET during any assessment phase.

  Warning findings, on the other hand, are given a risk rating (low, moderate, high or
  critical) by the scanning solution and should be treated like any other finding with a risk
  or severity rating for tracking purposes onto either the POA&M or RET depending on
  when the findings originated (during assessments or during monthly continuous
  monitoring). If a warning is received during scanning, but further validation turns up no
  actual issue then this item should be categorized as a false positive. If this situation
  presents itself during an assessment phase (initial assessment, annual assessment or
  any SCR), follow guidance on how to report false positives in the Security Assessment
  Report (SAR). If this situation happens during monthly continuous monitoring, a
  deviation request will need to be submitted per the FedRAMP Vulnerability Deviation
  Request Form.
  
  Warnings are commonly associated with scanning solutions that also perform
  compliance scans, and if the scanner reports a “warning” as part of the compliance
  scanning of a CSO, follow guidance surrounding the tracking of compliance findings
  during either the assessment phases (initial assessment, annual assessment or any
  SCR) or monthly continuous monitoring as it applies. Guidance on compliance scan
  findings can be found by searching on “Tracking of Compliance Scans” in FAQs.
  
  **(a) Requirement**: an accredited independent assessor scans operating
  systems/infrastructure, web applications, and databases once annually.
  
  **(d) Requirement**: If a vulnerability is listed among the CISA Known Exploited
  Vulnerability (KEV) Catalog
  (<https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog>) the KEV remediation date
  supersedes the FedRAMP parameter requirement.
  
  **(e) Requirement**: to include all Authorizing Officials; for JAB authorizations to include
  FedRAMP.
