name: 9.1 Ensure App Service Authentication is set up for apps in Azure App Service
  - Level 2 (Automated)
description: "Azure App Service Authentication is a feature that can prevent anonymous\
  \ HTTP requests from reaching the API app, or authenticate those that have tokens\
  \ before they reach the API app. If an anonymous request is received from a browser,\
  \ App Service will redirect to a logon page. To handle the logon process, a choice\
  \ from a set of identity providers can be made, or a custom authentication mechanism\
  \ can be implemented."
