name: "3.5 Ensure Storage Logging is Enabled for Queue Service for 'Read', 'Write',\
  \ and 'Delete' requests - Level 2 (Automated)"
description: "The Storage Queue service stores messages that may be read by any client\
  \ who has access to the storage account. A queue can contain an unlimited number\
  \ of messages, each of which can be up to 64KB in size using version 2011-08-18\
  \ or newer. Storage Logging happens server-side and allows details for both successful\
  \ and failed requests to be recorded in the storage account. These logs allow users\
  \ to see the details of read, write, and delete operations against the queues. Storage\
  \ Logging log entries contain the following information about individual requests:\
  \ Timing information such as start time, end-to-end latency, and server latency,\
  \ authentication details, concurrency information, and the sizes of the request\
  \ and response messages."
