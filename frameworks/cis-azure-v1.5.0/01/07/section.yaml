  \ - Level 1 (Manual | Not supported, no API/CLI available by Azure)"
description: |-
  Microsoft Azure creates a default bad password policy that is already applied to Azure administrative and normal user accounts. This is not applied to user accounts that are synced from an on-premise Active Directory unless Azure AD Connect is used and you enable EnforceCloudPasswordPolicyForPasswordSyncedUsers.
  Please see the list in default values on the specifics of this policy.
