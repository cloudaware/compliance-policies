name: 1.4 Ensure Guest Users Are Reviewed on a Regular Basis - Level 1 (Manual | Assessment
  requires a manual procedure. Hover over the title for the full description)
description: "This recommendation assessment can be achieved only by a manual process\
  \ using the cloud configuration rule 'Azure Active Directory should not include\
  \ guest users' (IAM-044). This rule provides visibility to Guest users. Azure AD\
  \ is extended to include Azure AD B2B collaboration, allowing you to invite people\
  \ from outside your organization to be guest users in your cloud account and sign\
  \ in with their own work, school, or social identities. Guest users allow you to\
  \ share your company's applications and services with users from any other organization,\
  \ while maintaining control over your own corporate data. \n\nWork with external\
  \ partners, large or small, even if they don't have Azure AD or an IT department.\
  \ A simple invitation and redemption process lets partners use their own credentials\
  \ to access your company's resources as a guest user.\n\nGuest users in every subscription\
  \ should be review on a regular basis to ensure that inactive and unneeded accounts\
  \ are removed."
