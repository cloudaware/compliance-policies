name: "1.22 Ensure Security Defaults is enabled on Azure Active Directory - Level\
  \ 1 (Automated | Not supported, no API/CLI available by Azure)"
description: |-
  Security defaults in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) make it easier to be secure and help protect your organization. Security defaults contain preconfigured security settings for common attacks.

  Microsoft is making security defaults available to everyone. The goal is to ensure that all organizations have a basic level of security-enabled at no extra cost. You turn on security defaults in the Azure portal. Please note that according to the CIS Benchmark audit steps, at this point in time, there is no API/CLI mechanism available to programmatically conduct a security assessment for this recommendation.
