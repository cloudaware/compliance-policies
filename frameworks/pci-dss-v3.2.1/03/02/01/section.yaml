  3.2.1 Do not store the full contents of any track (from the magnetic stripe located on the back of a card, equivalent data contained on a chip, or elsewhere) after authorization. This data is alternatively called full track, track, track 1, track 2, and magnetic-stripe data.
  Note: In the normal course of business, the following data elements from the magnetic stripe may need to be retained:
  • The cardholder’s name
  • Primary account number (PAN)
  • Expiration date
  • Service code
  To minimize risk, store only these data elements as needed for business.
