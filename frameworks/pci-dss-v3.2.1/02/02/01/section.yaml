  2.2.1 Implement only one primary function per server to prevent functions that require different security levels from co-existing on the same server. (For example, web servers, database servers, and DNS should be implemented on separate servers.)
  Note: Where virtualization technologies are in use, implement only one primary function per virtual system component.
