  6.6 For public-facing web applications, address new threats and vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis and ensure these applications are protected against known attacks by either of the following methods:
  • Reviewing public-facing web applications via manual or automated application vulnerability security assessment tools or methods, at least annually and after any changes
  Note: This assessment is not the same as the vulnerability scans performed for Requirement 11.2.
  • Installing an automated technical solution that detects and prevents web-based attacks (for example, a web application firewall) in front of public facing web applications, to continually check all traffic.
