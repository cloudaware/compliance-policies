  6.3.2  Review custom code prior to release to production or customers in order to identify any potential coding vulnerability (using either manual or automated processes) to include at least the following:
  • Code changes are reviewed by individuals other than the originating code author, and by individuals knowledgeable about code-review techniques and secure coding practices.
  • Code reviews ensure code is developed according to secure coding guidelines
  • Appropriate corrections are implemented prior to release.
  • Code-review results are reviewed and approved by management prior to release.

  Note: This requirement for code reviews applies to all custom code (both internal and public-facing), as part of the system development life cycle. Code reviews can be conducted by knowledgeable internal personnel or third parties. Public-facing web applications are also subject to additional controls, to address ongoing threats and vulnerabilities after implementation, as defined at PCI DSS Requirement 6.6.
