  6.5 Address common coding vulnerabilities in software-development processes as follows:
  • Train developers at least annually in upto-date secure coding techniques, including how to avoid common coding vulnerabilities.
  • Develop applications based on secure
  coding guidelines.

  Note: The vulnerabilities listed at 6.5.1 through 6.5.10 were current with industry best practices when this version of PCI DSS was published. However, as industry best practices for vulnerability management are updated (for example, the OWASP Guide, SANS CWE Top 25, CERT Secure Coding, etc.), the current best practices must be used for these requirements.
