  5.3 Ensure that anti-virus mechanisms are actively running and cannot be disabled or altered by users, unless specifically authorized by management on a case-by-case basis for a limited time period.
  Note: Anti-virus solutions may be temporarily disabled only if there is legitimate technical need, as authorized by management on a case-by-case basis. If anti-virus protection needs to be disabled for a specific purpose, it must be formally authorized. Additional security measures may also need to be implemented for the period of time during which anti-virus protection is not active.
