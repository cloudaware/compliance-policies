name: 1.10 Ensure KMS Encryption Keys Are Rotated Within a Period of 90 Days - Level
  1 (Automated)
description: "Google Cloud Key Management Service stores cryptographic keys in a hierarchical\
  \ structure designed for useful and elegant access control management. \n\nThe format\
  \ for the rotation schedule depends on the client library that is used. For the\
  \ gcloud command-line tool, the next rotation time must be in `ISO` or `RFC3339`\
  \ format, and the rotation period must be in the form `INTEGER[UNIT]`, where units\
  \ can be one of seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h) or days (d)."
