name: 1.12 Ensure API Keys Only Exist for Active Services - Level 2 (Automated)
description: "API Keys should only be used for services in cases where other authentication\
  \ methods are unavailable. Unused keys with their permissions in tact may still\
  \ exist within a project. Keys are insecure because they can be viewed publicly,\
  \ such as from within a browser, or they can be accessed on a device where the key\
  \ resides. It is recommended to use standard authentication flow instead."
