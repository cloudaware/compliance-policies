name: 4.7 Ensure VM Disks for Critical VMs Are Encrypted With Customer-Supplied Encryption
  Keys (CSEK) - Level 2 (Automated)
description: "Customer-Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEK) are a feature in Google Cloud\
  \ Storage and Google Compute Engine. If you supply your own encryption keys, Google\
  \ uses your key to protect the Google-generated keys used to encrypt and decrypt\
  \ your data. By default, Google Compute Engine encrypts all data at rest. Compute\
  \ Engine handles and manages this encryption for you without any additional actions\
  \ on your part. However, if you wanted to control and manage this encryption yourself,\
  \ you can provide your own encryption keys."
