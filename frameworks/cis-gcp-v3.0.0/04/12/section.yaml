name: 4.12 Ensure the Latest Operating System Updates Are Installed On Your Virtual
  Machines in All Projects - Level 2 (Manual)
description: |-
  Google Cloud Virtual Machines have the ability via an OS Config agent API to periodically (about every 10 minutes) report OS inventory data. A patch compliance API periodically reads this data, and cross references metadata to determine if the latest updates are installed.

  This is not the only Patch Management solution available to your organization and you should weigh your needs before committing to using this method.
