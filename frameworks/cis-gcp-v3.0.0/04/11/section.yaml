name: 4.11 Ensure That Compute Instances Have Confidential Computing Enabled - Level
  2 (Automated)
description: "Google Cloud encrypts data at-rest and in-transit, but customer data\
  \ must be decrypted for processing. Confidential Computing is a breakthrough technology\
  \ which encrypts data in-use—while it is being processed. Confidential Computing\
  \ environments keep data encrypted in memory and elsewhere outside the central processing\
  \ unit (CPU). \n\nConfidential VMs leverage the Secure Encrypted Virtualization\
  \ (SEV) feature of AMD EPYC™ CPUs. Customer data will stay encrypted while it is\
  \ used, indexed, queried, or trained on. Encryption keys are generated in hardware,\
  \ per VM, and not exportable. Thanks to built-in hardware optimizations of both\
  \ performance and security, there is no significant performance penalty to Confidential\
  \ Computing workloads."
