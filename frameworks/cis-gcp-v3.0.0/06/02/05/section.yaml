name: 6.2.5 Ensure that the ‘Log_min_messages’ Flag for a Cloud SQL PostgreSQL Instance
  is set at minimum to 'Warning' - Level 1 (Automated)
description: |-
  The `log_min_messages` flag defines the minimum message severity level that is considered as an error statement. Messages for error statements are logged with the SQL statement. Valid values include (from lowest to highest severity) `DEBUG5`, `DEBUG4`, `DEBUG3`, `DEBUG2`, `DEBUG1`, `INFO`, `NOTICE`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `LOG`, `FATAL`, and `PANIC`.
  Each severity level includes the subsequent levels mentioned above. ERROR is considered the best practice setting. Changes should only be made in accordance with the organization's logging policy.
