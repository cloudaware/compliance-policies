name: 1.2 Ensure multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users that
  have a console password
description: "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection\
  \ on top of a user name and password. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to\
  \ an AWS website, they will be prompted for their user name and password as well\
  \ as for an authentication code from their AWS MFA device. It is recommended that\
  \ MFA be enabled for all accounts that have a console password."
