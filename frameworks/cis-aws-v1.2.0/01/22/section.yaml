name: 1.22 Ensure IAM policies that allow full "*:*" administrative privileges are
  not created
description: "IAM policies are the means by which privileges are granted to users,\
  \ groups, or roles. It is recommended and considered a standard security advice\
  \ to grant _least privilege_—that is, granting only the permissions required to\
  \ perform a task. Determine what users need to do and then craft policies for them\
  \ that let the users perform _only_ those tasks, instead of allowing full administrative\
  \ privileges."
