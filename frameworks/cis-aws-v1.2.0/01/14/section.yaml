name: 1.14 Ensure hardware MFA is enabled for the "root" account
description: "The root account is the most privileged user in an AWS account. MFA\
  \ adds an extra layer of protection on top of a user name and password. With MFA\
  \ enabled, when a user signs in to an AWS website, they will be prompted for their\
  \ user name and password as well as for an authentication code from their AWS MFA\
  \ device. For Level 2, it is recommended that the root account be protected with\
  \ a hardware MFA."
