name: 7.2 Ensure That All BigQuery Tables Are Encrypted With Customer-Managed Encryption
  Key (CMEK) - Level 2 (Automated)
description: "BigQuery by default encrypts the data as rest by employing Envelope\
  \ Encryption using Google managed cryptographic keys. The data is encrypted using\
  \ the data encryption keys and data encryption keys themselves are further encrypted\
  \ using key encryption keys. This is seamless and do not require any additional\
  \ input from the user. However, if you want to have greater control, Customer-managed\
  \ encryption keys (CMEK) can be used as encryption key management solution for BigQuery\
  \ Data Sets. If CMEK is used, the CMEK is used to encrypt the data encryption keys\
  \ instead of using google-managed encryption keys."
