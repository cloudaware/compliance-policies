name: 6.2.9 Ensure Instance IP assignment is set to private - Level 1 (Automated)
description: |-
  Instance addresses can be public IP or private IP. Public IP means that the instance is accessible through the public internet. In contrast, instances using only private IP are not accessible through the public internet, but are accessible through a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

  Limiting network access to your database will limit potential attacks.
