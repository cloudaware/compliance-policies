name: 2.4 Ensure Log Metric Filter and Alerts Exist for Project Ownership Assignments/Changes
  - Level 1 (Automated)
description: |-
  In order to prevent unnecessary project ownership assignments to users/service-accounts and further misuses of projects and resources, all roles/Owner assignments should be monitored.

  Members (users/Service-Accounts) with a role assignment to primitive role roles/Owner are project owners.

  The project owner has all the privileges on the project the role belongs to. These are summarized below:
  - All viewer permissions on all GCP Services within the project
  - Permissions for actions that modify the state of all GCP services within the project
  - Manage roles and permissions for a project and all resources within the project
  - Set up billing for a project

  Granting the owner role to a member (user/Service-Account) will allow that member to modify the Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. Therefore, grant the owner role only if the member has a legitimate purpose to manage the IAM policy. This is because the project IAM policy contains sensitive access control data. Having a minimal set of users allowed to manage IAM policy will simplify any auditing that may be necessary.
