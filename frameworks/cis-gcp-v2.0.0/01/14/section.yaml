name: 1.14 Ensure API Keys Are Restricted to Only APIs That Application Needs Access
  - Level 2 (Automated)
description: "API Keys should only be used for services in cases where other authentication\
  \ methods are unavailable. API keys are always at risk because they can be viewed\
  \ publicly, such as from within a browser, or they can be accessed on a device where\
  \ the key resides. It is recommended to restrict API keys to use (call) only APIs\
  \ required by an application."
