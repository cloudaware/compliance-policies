name: 1.13 Ensure API Keys Are Restricted To Use by Only Specified Hosts and Apps
  - Level 2 (Manual)
description: "API Keys should only be used for services in cases where other authentication\
  \ methods are unavailable. In this case, unrestricted keys are insecure because\
  \ they can be viewed publicly, such as from within a browser, or they can be accessed\
  \ on a device where the key resides. It is recommended to restrict API key usage\
  \ to trusted hosts, HTTP referrers and apps. It is recommended to use the more secure\
  \ standard authentication flow instead."
