name: 3.9 Ensure no HTTPS or SSL proxy load balancers permit SSL policies with weak
  cipher suites
description: "Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) policies determine what port Transport Layer\
  \ Security (TLS) features clients are permitted to use when connecting to load balancers.\
  \ To prevent usage of insecure features, SSL policies should use (a) at least TLS\
  \ 1.2 with the MODERN profile; or (b) the RESTRICTED profile, because it effectively\
  \ requires clients to use TLS 1.2 regardless of the chosen minimum TLS version;\
  \ or (3) a CUSTOM profile that does not support any of the following features: \n\
  '''\nTLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\nTLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\nTLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA\n\
  TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA\nTLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA\n'''"
