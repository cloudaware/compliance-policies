name: 3.6 Ensure that SSH access is restricted from the internet
description: |-
  GCP 'Firewall Rules' are specific to a 'VPC Network'. Each rule either 'allows' or 'denies' traffic when its conditions are met. Its conditions allow the user to specify the type of traffic, such as ports and protocols, and the source or destination of the traffic, including IP addresses, subnets, and instances.

  Firewall rules are defined at the VPC network level and are specific to the network in which they are defined. The rules themselves cannot be shared among networks. Firewall rules only support IPv4 traffic. When specifying a source for an ingress rule or a destination for an egress rule by address, only an 'IPv4' address or 'IPv4 block in CIDR' notation can be used. Generic '(0.0.0.0/0)' incoming traffic from the internet to VPC or VM instance using 'SSH' on 'Port 22' can be avoided.
