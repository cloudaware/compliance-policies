name: 3.10 Ensure that Object-level logging for write events is enabled for S3 bucket
  - Level 2 (Automated)
description: "S3 object-level API operations such as GetObject, DeleteObject, and\
  \ PutObject are called data events. By default, CloudTrail trails don't log data\
  \ events and so it is recommended to enable Object-level logging for S3 buckets."
