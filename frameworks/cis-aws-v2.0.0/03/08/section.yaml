name: 3.8 Ensure rotation for customer created symmetric CMKs is enabled - Level 2
  (Automated)
description: AWS Key Management Service (KMS) allows customers to rotate the backing
  key which is key material stored within the KMS which is tied to the key ID of the
  Customer Created customer master key (CMK). It is the backing key that is used to
  perform cryptographic operations such as encryption and decryption. Automated key
  rotation currently retains all prior backing keys so that decryption of encrypted
  data can take place transparently. It is recommended that CMK key rotation be enabled
  for symmetric keys. Key rotation can not be enabled for any asymmetric CMK.
