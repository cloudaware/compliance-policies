name: "4.8 Ensure 'Allow Azure services on the trusted services list to access this storage account' is Enabled for Storage Account Access (Automated)"
description: |-
  **NOTE**: This recommendation assumes that the `Public network access` parameter is set to `Enabled 
  from selected virtual networks and IP addresses`. Please ensure the prerequisite recommendation 
  has been implemented before proceeding:
  
  - Ensure Default Network Access Rule for Storage Accounts is Set to Deny
  
  Some Azure services that interact with storage accounts operate from networks that can't be 
  granted access through network rules. To help this type of service work as intended, allow the 
  set of trusted Azure services to bypass the network rules. These services will then use strong 
  authentication to access the storage account. If the `Allow Azure services on the trusted services 
  list to access this storage account` exception is enabled, the following services are granted access 
  to the storage account: Azure Backup, Azure Data Box, Azure DevTest Labs, Azure Event Grid, Azure 
  Event Hubs, Azure File Sync, Azure HDInsight, Azure Import/Export, Azure Monitor, Azure Networking 
  Services, and Azure Site Recovery (when registered in the subscription).
