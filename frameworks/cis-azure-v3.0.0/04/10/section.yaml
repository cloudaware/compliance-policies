name: "4.10 Ensure Soft Delete is Enabled for Azure Containers and Blob Storage (Automated)"
description: |-
  The Azure Storage blobs contain data like ePHI or Financial, which can be secret or personal. 
  Data that is erroneously modified or deleted by an application or other storage account user will 
  cause data loss or unavailability.
  
  It is recommended that both Azure Containers with attached Blob Storage and standalone containers 
  with Blob Storage be made recoverable by enabling the **soft delete** configuration. This is to save 
  and recover data when blobs or blob snapshots are deleted.
