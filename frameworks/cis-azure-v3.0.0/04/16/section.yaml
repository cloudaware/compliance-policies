name: "4.16 Ensure 'Cross Tenant Replication' is not enabled (Automated)"
description: >
  Cross Tenant Replication in Azure allows data to be replicated across multiple Azure tenants. 
  While this feature can be beneficial for data sharing and availability, it also poses a significant 
  security risk if not properly managed. Unauthorized data access, data leakage, and compliance 
  violations are potential risks. Disabling Cross Tenant Replication ensures that data is not 
  inadvertently replicated across different tenant boundaries without explicit authorization.
