name: "9.1 Ensure 'HTTPS Only' is set to 'On' (Automated)"
description: >
  Azure App Service allows apps to run under both HTTP and HTTPS by default. Apps can be accessed by 
  anyone using non-secure HTTP links by default. Non-secure HTTP requests can be restricted and all 
  HTTP requests redirected to the secure HTTPS port. It is recommended to enforce HTTPS-only traffic.
