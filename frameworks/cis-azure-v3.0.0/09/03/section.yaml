name: "9.3 Ensure 'FTP State' is set to 'FTPS Only' or 'Disabled' (Automated)"
description: |-
  By default, App Services can be deployed over FTP. If FTP is required for an essential deployment 
  workflow, FTPS should be required for FTP login for all App Services.
  
  If FTPS is not expressly required for the App, the recommended setting is `Disabled`.
