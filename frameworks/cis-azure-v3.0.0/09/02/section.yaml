name: "9.2 Ensure App Service Authentication is set up for apps in Azure App Service (Automated)"
description: >
  Azure App Service Authentication is a feature that can prevent anonymous HTTP requests from 
  reaching a Web Application or authenticate those with tokens before they reach the app. If an 
  anonymous request is received from a browser, App Service will redirect to a logon page. To 
  handle the logon process, a choice from a set of identity providers can be made, or a custom 
  authentication mechanism can be implemented.
