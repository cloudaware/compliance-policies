name: "9.6 Ensure that 'Basic Authentication' is 'Disabled' (Manual)"
description: >
  Basic Authentication provides the ability to create identities and authentication for an 
  App Service without a centralized Identity Provider. For a more effective, capable, and secure 
  solution for Identity, Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability, a centralized Identity 
  Provider such as Entra ID is strongly advised.
