name: "6.3.1 Ensure Application Insights are Configured (Automated)"
description: >
  Application Insights within Azure act as an Application Performance Monitoring solution providing 
  valuable data into how well an application performs and additional information when performing 
  incident response. The types of log data collected include application metrics, telemetry data, 
  and application trace logging data providing organizations with detailed information about 
  application activity and application transactions. Both data sets help organizations adopt a 
  proactive and retroactive means to handle security and performance related metrics within their 
  modern applications.
