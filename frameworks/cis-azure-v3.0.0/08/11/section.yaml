name: "8.11 Ensure Trusted Launch is enabled on Virtual Machines (Automated)"
description: >
  When **Secure Boot** and **vTPM** are enabled together, they provide a strong foundation for protecting 
  your VM from boot attacks. For example, if an attacker attempts to replace the bootloader with a 
  malicious version, Secure Boot will prevent the VM from booting. If the attacker is able to bypass 
  Secure Boot and install a malicious bootloader, vTPM can be used to detect the intrusion and alert you.
