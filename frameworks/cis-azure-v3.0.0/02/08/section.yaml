name: "2.8 Ensure that a Custom Bad Password List is set to 'Enforce' for your Organization (Manual)"
description: |-
  Microsoft Azure provides a Global Banned Password policy that applies to Azure administrative 
  and normal user accounts. This is not applied to user accounts that are synced from an on-premise 
  Active Directory unless Microsoft Entra ID Connect is used and you enable 
  EnforceCloudPasswordPolicyForPasswordSyncedUsers. Please see the list in default values on the 
  specifics of this policy. To further password security, it is recommended to further define a 
  custom banned password policy.
