  **NOTE**: This recommendation is only relevant if your subscription is using Per-User MFA. 
  If your organization is licensed to use Conditional Access, the preferred method of requiring 
  MFA to join devices to Entra ID is to use a Conditional Access policy (see additional information 
  below for link).
  
  Joining or registering devices to Microsoft Entra ID should require multi-factor authentication.
