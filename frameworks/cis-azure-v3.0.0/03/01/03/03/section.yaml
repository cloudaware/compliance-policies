name: "3.1.3.3 Ensure that 'Endpoint protection' component status is set to 'On' (Manual)"
description: |-
  The Endpoint protection component enables Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (formerly 'Advanced 
  Threat Protection' or 'ATP' or 'WDATP' - see additional info) to communicate with Microsoft 
  Defender for Cloud.
  
  **IMPORTANT**: When enabling integration between DfE & DfC it needs to be taken into account that 
  this will have some side effects that may be undesirable.
  
  1. For server 2019 & above if defender is installed (default for these server SKUs) this will 
  trigger a deployment of the new unified agent and link to any of the extended configuration in 
  the Defender portal.
  2. If the new unified agent is required for server SKUs of Win 2016 or Linux and lower there is 
  additional integration that needs to be switched on and agents need to be aligned.
