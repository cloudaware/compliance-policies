name: "3.3.6 Enable Role Based Access Control for Azure Key Vault (Automated)"
description: |-
  The recommended way to access Key Vaults is to use the Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
  permissions model.

  Azure RBAC is an authorization system built on Azure Resource Manager that provides fine-grained 
  access management of Azure resources. It allows users to manage Key, Secret, and Certificate 
  permissions. It provides one place to manage all permissions across all key vaults.
