description: |-
  1. Logically segment organization networks and cloud-based platforms according to trust boundaries 
  and platform types (e.g., IT, IoT, OT, mobile, guests), and permit required communications only 
  between segments
  2. Logically segment organization networks from external networks, and permit only necessary 
  communications to enter the organization's networks from the external networks
  3. Implement zero trust architectures to restrict network access to each resource to the minimum necessary
  4. Check the cyber health of endpoints before allowing them to access and use production resources
