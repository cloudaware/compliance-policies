description: |-
  1. Further review and categorize incidents based on the type of incident (e.g., data breach, 
  ransomware, DDoS, account compromise)
  2. Prioritize incidents based on their scope, likely impact, and time-critical nature
  3. Select incident response strategies for active incidents by balancing the need to quickly 
  recover from an incident with the need to observe the attacker or conduct a more thorough investigation
