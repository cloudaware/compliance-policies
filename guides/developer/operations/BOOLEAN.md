# `BOOLEAN`

Constructs an operation that returns a user-specified constant `bool`.

You can not construct `null` boolean. There is a special operation in case you need to check something is empty or null - [`IS_EMPTY`](IS_EMPTY%20or%20NOT_EMPTY.md)

**Inputs**:

- `arg` - boolean in YAML
  
**Output**: [`BooleanType`](../data-types.md#booleantype)
