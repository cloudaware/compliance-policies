# Description

A service account is a special Google account that belongs to an application or a VM, instead of to an individual end-user. The application uses the service account to call the service's Google API so that users aren't directly involved. It's recommended not to use admin access for ServiceAccount.

## Rationale

Service accounts represent service-level security of the Resources (application or a VM) which can be determined by the roles assigned to it. Enrolling ServiceAccount with Admin rights gives full access to an assigned application or a VM. A ServiceAccount Access holder can perform critical actions like delete, update change settings, etc. without user intervention. For this reason, it's recommended that service accounts not have Admin rights.

## Impact

Removing `*Admin` or `*admin` or `Editor` or `Owner` role assignments from service accounts may break functionality that uses impacted service accounts. Required role(s) should be assigned to impacted service accounts in order to restore broken functionalities.

## Audit

### From Google Cloud Console

1. Go to `IAM & admin/IAM` using <https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam>
2. Under the `IAM` Tab look for `VIEW BY PRINCIPALS`
3. Filter `PRINCIPALS` using `type : Service account`
4. Look for the Service Account with the nomenclature: `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
5. Ensure that there are no such Service Accounts with roles containing `*Admin` or `*admin` or role matching `Editor` or role matching `Owner` under `Role` column.

### From Google Cloud CLI

1. Get the policy that you want to modify, and write it to a JSON file:

      gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID --format json > iam.json

2. The contents of the JSON file will look similar to the following. Note that `role` of members group associated with each `serviceaccount` does not contain `*Admin` or `*admin` or does not match `roles/editor` or does not match `roles/owner`.

This recommendation is only applicable to `User-Managed user-created` service accounts. These accounts have the nomenclature:
`SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com`. Note that some Google-managed, Google-created service accounts have the same naming format, and should be excluded (e.g., `appsdev-apps-dev-script-auth@system.gserviceaccount.com` which needs the Owner role).

Sample Json output:

     {
       "bindings": [ 
                  { "members": [ "serviceAccount:our-project-123@appspot.gserviceaccount.com", ], "role": "roles/appengine.appAdmin" }, 
                  { "members": [ "user:email1@gmail.com" ], "role": "roles/owner" }, 
                  { "members": [ "serviceAccount:our-project-123@appspot.gserviceaccount.com", "serviceAccount:123456789012-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" ], "role": "roles/editor" } 
                  ], 
      "etag": "BwUjMhCsNvY=", 
      "version": 1 
      }

## Default Value

User Managed (and not user-created) default service accounts have the `Editor (roles/editor)` role assigned to them to support GCP services they offer.
By default, there are no roles assigned to `User Managed User created` service accounts.

## Additional Information

Default (user-managed but not user-created) service accounts have the `Editor (roles/editor)` role assigned to them to support GCP services they offer. Such Service accounts are: `PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`, `PROJECT_ID@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`.
