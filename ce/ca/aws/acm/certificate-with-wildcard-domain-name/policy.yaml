  contextual: Certificate with Wildcard Domain Name
description: "Ensure that ACM single domain name certificates are used instead of\
  \ wildcard certificates within your AWS account in order to follow security best\
  \ practices and protect each domain/subdomain with its own unique private key. An\
  \ AWS ACM wildcard certificate matches any first level subdomain or hostname in\
  \ a domain. For example, a wildcard certificate issued for *.cloudaware.com can\
  \ protect both www.cloudaware.com and images.cloudaware.com."
