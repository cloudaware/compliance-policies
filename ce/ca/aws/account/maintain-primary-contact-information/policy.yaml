description: "Ensure contact email and telephone details for AWS accounts are current\
  \ and map to more than one individual in your organization. An AWS account supports\
  \ a number of contact details, and AWS will use these to contact the account owner\
  \ if activity judged to be in breach of Acceptable Use Policy or indicative of likely\
  \ security compromise is observed by the AWS Abuse team. Contact details should\
  \ not be for a single individual, as circumstances may arise where that individual\
  \ is unavailable. Email contact details should point to a mail alias which forwards\
  \ email to multiple individuals within the organization; where feasible, phone contact\
  \ details should point to a PABX hunt group or other call-forwarding system."
