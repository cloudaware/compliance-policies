description: "Enable IAM Access analyzer for IAM policies about all resources in each\
  \ active AWS region. IAM Access Analyzer is a technology introduced at AWS reinvent\
  \ 2019. After the Analyzer is enabled in IAM, scan results are displayed on the\
  \ console showing the accessible resources. Scans show resources that other accounts\
  \ and federated users can access, such as KMS keys and IAM roles. So the results\
  \ allow you to determine if an unintended user is allowed, making it easier for\
  \ administrators to monitor least privileges access. Access Analyzer analyzes only\
  \ policies that are applied to resources in the same AWS Region."
