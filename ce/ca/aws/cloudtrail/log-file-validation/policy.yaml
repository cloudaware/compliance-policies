description: "CloudTrail log file validation creates a digitally signed digest file\
  \ containing a hash of each log that CloudTrail writes to S3. These digest files\
  \ can be used to determine whether a log file was changed, deleted, or unchanged\
  \ after CloudTrail delivered the log. It is recommended that file validation be\
  \ enabled on all CloudTrails."
