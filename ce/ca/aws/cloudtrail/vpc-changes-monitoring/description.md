# Description

Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to
CloudWatch Logs or an external Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
environment, and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms.

It is possible to have more than one VPC within an account; additionally, it is also
possible to create a peer connection between two VPCs, enabling network traffic to
route between them.

It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for changes made to
VPCs.

## Rationale

CloudWatch is an AWS native service that allows you to observe and monitor resources and applications. CloudTrail Logs can also be sent to an external Security information and event management (SIEM) environment for monitoring and alerting.

VPCs in AWS are logically isolated virtual networks that can be used to launch AWS resources. Monitoring changes to VPC configuration will help ensure VPC traffic flow is not getting impacted. Changes to VPCs can impact network accessibility from the public internet and additionally impact VPC traffic flow to and from resources launched in the VPC.

## Audit

If you are using CloudTrails and CloudWatch, perform the following to ensure that there is at least one active multi-region CloudTrail with prescribed metric filters and alarms configured:

1. Identify the log group name configured for use with active multi-region CloudTrail:

- List all CloudTrails:

```sh
aws cloudtrail describe-trails
```

- Identify Multi region Cloudtrails: Trails with `IsMultiRegionTrail` set to `true`.
- From value associated with CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn note `<cloudtrail_log_group_name>`.

Example: for CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn that looks like `arn:aws:logs:<region>:<aws_account_number>:log-group:NewGroup:*`, `<cloudtrail_log_group_name>` would be `NewGroup`.

- Ensure Identified Multi region CloudTrail is active:

```sh
aws cloudtrail get-trail-status --name <Name of a Multi-region CloudTrail>
```

Ensure `IsLogging` is set to `TRUE`.

â€¢
Ensure identified Multi-region Cloudtrail captures all Management Events:

```sh
aws cloudtrail get-event-selectors --trail-name <trailname shown in describe-trails>
```

Ensure there is at least one Event Selector for a Trail with `IncludeManagementEvents` set to `true` and `ReadWriteType` set to `All`.

2. Get a list of all associated metric filters for this `<cloudtrail_log_group_name>`:

```sh
aws logs describe-metric-filters --log-group-name <cloudtrail_log_group_name>
```

3. Ensure the output from the above command contains the following:

```json
"filterPattern": "{ ($.eventName = CreateVpc) || ($.eventName = DeleteVpc) || ($.eventName = ModifyVpcAttribute) || ($.eventName = AcceptVpcPeeringConnection) || ($.eventName = CreateVpcPeeringConnection) || ($.eventName = DeleteVpcPeeringConnection) || ($.eventName = RejectVpcPeeringConnection) || ($.eventName = AttachClassicLinkVpc) || ($.eventName = DetachClassicLinkVpc) || ($.eventName = DisableVpcClassicLink) || ($.eventName = EnableVpcClassicLink) }"
```

4. Note the `<vpc_changes_metric>` value associated with the `filterPattern` found in step 3.
5. Get a list of CloudWatch alarms and filter on the `<vpc_changes_metric>` captured in step 4:

```sh
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --query 'MetricAlarms[?MetricName== `<vpc_changes_metric>`]'
```

6. Note the `AlarmActions` value - this will provide the SNS topic ARN value.
7. Ensure there is at least one active subscriber to the SNS topic:

```sh
aws sns list-subscriptions-by-topic --topic-arn <sns_topic_arn>
```

At least one subscription should have `SubscriptionArn` with valid aws ARN.

Example of valid `SubscriptionArn`: `arn:aws:sns:<region>:<aws_account_number>:<SnsTopicName>:<SubscriptionID>`.

## Additional Information

Configuring log metric filter and alarm on Multi-region (global) CloudTrail:

- Ensures that activities from all regions (used as well as unused) are monitored.
- Ensures that activities on all supported global services are monitored.
- Ensures that all management events across all regions are monitored.
