  full: Enable AWS EC2 Instance Detailed Monitoring
  contextual: Enable Instance Detailed Monitoring
description: "Ensure that detailed monitoring is enabled for your Amazon EC2 instances\
  \ in order to have enough monitoring data to help you make better decisions on architecting\
  \ and managing compute resources within your AWS account. By default, whenever an\
  \ EC2 instance is launched, AWS CloudWatch enables basic monitoring for that instance.\
  \ The basic monitoring level collects monitoring data in 5 minute periods. To increase\
  \ this level and make the monitoring data available at 1-minute periods, you must\
  \ specifically enable it for your instance(s). With detailed monitoring, you can\
  \ also get aggregated data across groups of similar EC2 instances."
