description: "Migrate EC2 instances that don't need internet access to a private subnet,\
  \ or remove the direct route to an Internet Gateway within the subnet. EC2 Instances\
  \ without a public IPv4/IPv6 address are unable to connect to the internet thus\
  \ making it a potential misconfiguration that can lead to security breaches, convoluted\
  \ network architecture, and unnecessary management overhead. Consider using a bastion\
  \ host or NAT device to provide internet access to EC2 instances that do not require\
  \ to be public."
