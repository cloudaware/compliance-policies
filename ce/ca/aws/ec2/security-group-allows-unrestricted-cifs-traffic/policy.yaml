description: >
  Common Internet File System (CIFS) is a network file-sharing protocol that allows
  systems to share files over a network. However, unrestricted CIFS access can expose
  your data to unauthorized users, leading to potential security risks. It is important to
  restrict CIFS access to only trusted networks and users to prevent unauthorized access
  and data breaches.
