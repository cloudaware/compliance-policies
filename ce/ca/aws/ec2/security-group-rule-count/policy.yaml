description: "Determine if there is a large number of inbound and outbound rules defined\
  \ within your AWS EC2 security groups and reduce their number by removing any unnecessary\
  \ or overlapping rules. To improve performance and efficiency CloudAware recommends\
  \ a default value of 50 for the maximum number of rules assigned to a security group,\
  \ however, this value is configurable so you can adjust it based on your requirements."
