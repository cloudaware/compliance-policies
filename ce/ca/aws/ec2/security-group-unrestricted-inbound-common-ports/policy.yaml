  contextual: Unrestricted Security Group Inbound Access on Common Ports
description: Check your EC2 security groups for inbound rules that allow unrestricted
  access (i.e. 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0) to ports used by popular services and restrict access
  to only those IP addresses that require it in order to implement the principle of
  least privilege and reduce the possibility of a breach.
