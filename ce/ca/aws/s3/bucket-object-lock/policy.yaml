description: "S3 Object Lock can help prevent Amazon S3 objects from being deleted\
  \ or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. Object Lock uses a\
  \ write-once-read-many (WORM) model to store objects. You can use Object Lock to\
  \ help meet regulatory requirements that require WORM storage, or to add another\
  \ layer of protection against object changes or deletion."
