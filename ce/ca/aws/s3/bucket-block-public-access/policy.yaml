  contextual: Bucket is not configured to block public access
description: "Amazon S3 provides `Block public access (bucket settings)` and `Block\
  \ public access (account settings)` to help you manage public access to Amazon S3\
  \ resources. By default, S3 buckets and objects are created with public access disabled.\
  \ However, an IAM principal with sufficient S3 permissions can enable public access\
  \ at the bucket and/or object level. While enabled, `Block public access (bucket\
  \ settings)` prevents an individual bucket, and its contained objects, from becoming\
  \ publicly accessible. Similarly, `Block public access (account settings)` prevents\
  \ all buckets, and contained objects, from becoming publicly accessible across the\
  \ entire account."
