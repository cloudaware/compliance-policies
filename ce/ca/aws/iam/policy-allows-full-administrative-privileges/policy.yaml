  contextual: Policy allows full administrative privileges
description: "IAM policies are the means by which privileges are granted to users,\
  \ groups, or roles. It is recommended and considered a standard security advice\
  \ to grant least privilege -that is, granting only the permissions required to perform\
  \ a task. Determine what users need to do and then craft policies for them that\
  \ let the users perform only those tasks, instead of allowing full administrative\
  \ privileges."
