  contextual: Root Account Credentials Usage
description: "Ensure that the AWS root account credentials have not been used within\
  \ the past 30 days (default threshold) to access your Amazon Web Services account\
  \ in order to keep the root account usage minimized. CloudAware strongly recommends\
  \ locking down the root account usage and terminating the usage of root credentials\
  \ for your everyday tasks, or even the administrative ones."
