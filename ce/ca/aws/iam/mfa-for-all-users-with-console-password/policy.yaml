description: "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of authentication\
  \ assurance beyond traditional credentials. With MFA enabled, when a user signs\
  \ in to the AWS Console, they will be prompted for their user name and password\
  \ as well as for an authentication code from their physical or virtual MFA token.\
  \ It is recommended that MFA be enabled for all accounts that have a console password."
