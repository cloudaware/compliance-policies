description: "AWS CloudShell is a convenient way of running CLI commands against AWS\
  \ services. AWSCloudShellFullAccess managed IAM policy provides full access to CloudShell,\
  \ which allows file upload and download capability between a user's local system\
  \ and the CloudShell environment. Within the CloudShell environment a user has sudo\
  \ permissions, and can access the internet. So it is feasible to install file transfer\
  \ software (for example) and move data from CloudShell to external internet servers."
