description: "Access keys consist of an access key ID and secret access key, which\
  \ are used to sign programmatic requests that you make to AWS. AWS users need their\
  \ own access keys to make programmatic calls to AWS from the AWS Command Line Interface\
  \ (AWS CLI), Tools for Windows PowerShell, the AWS SDKs, or direct HTTP calls using\
  \ the APIs for individual AWS services. It is recommended that all access keys be\
  \ regularly rotated."
