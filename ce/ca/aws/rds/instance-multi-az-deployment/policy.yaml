description: >
  Amazon RDS offers Multi-AZ deployments that provide enhanced availability and
  durability for your databases, using synchronous replication to replicate data to a
  standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). In the event of an infrastructure
  failure, Amazon RDS automatically fails over to the standby to minimize downtime and
  ensure business continuity.
