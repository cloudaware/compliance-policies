description: "The new RBAC permissions model for Key Vaults enables a much finer grained\
  \ access control for key vault secrets, keys, certificates, etc., than the   vault\
  \ access policy. This in turn will permit the use of privileged identity management\
  \ over these roles, thus securing the key vaults with JIT Access management."
