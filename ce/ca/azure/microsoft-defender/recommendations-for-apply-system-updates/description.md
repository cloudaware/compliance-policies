# Description

Ensure that the latest OS patches for all virtual machines are applied.

## Rationale

Windows and Linux virtual machines should be kept updated to:

- Address a specific bug or flaw
- Improve an OS or applicationâ€™s general stability
- Fix a security vulnerability

Microsoft Defender for Cloud retrieves a list of available security and critical updates from Windows Update or Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), depending on which service is configured on a Windows VM. The security center also checks for the latest updates in Linux systems. If a VM is missing a system update, the security center will recommend system updates be applied.

## Impact

Running Microsoft Defender for Cloud incurs additional charges for each resource monitored. Please see attached reference for exact charges per hour.

## Audit

### From Azure Portal

1. From Azure Home select the Portal Menu.
2. Select `Microsoft Defender for Cloud`.
3. Then the `Recommendations` blade.
4. Ensure that there are no recommendations for `Apply system updates`.

Alternatively, you can employ your own patch assessment and management tool to periodically assess, report and install the required security patches for your OS.
