description: "The use of Basic or Free SKUs in Azure whilst cost effective have significant\
  \ limitations in terms of what can be monitored and what support can be realized\
  \ from Microsoft. Typically, these SKU's do not have a service SLA and Microsoft\
  \ may refuse to provide support for them. Consequently Basic/Free SKUs should never\
  \ be used for production workloads."
