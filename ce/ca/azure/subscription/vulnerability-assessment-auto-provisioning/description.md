# Description

Enable automatic provisioning of vulnerability assessment for machines on both Azure and hybrid (Arc enabled) machines.

## Rationale

Vulnerability assessment for machines scans for various security-related configurations and events such as system updates, OS vulnerabilities, and endpoint protection, then produces alerts on threat and vulnerability findings.

## Impact

Additional licensing is required and configuration of Azure Arc introduces complexity beyond this recommendation.

## Audit

### From Azure Portal

1. From Azure Home select the Portal Menu.
2. Select `Microsoft Defender for Cloud`.
3. Under `Management`, select `Environment Settings`.
4. Select a subscription.
5. Click on `Settings & monitoring`.
6. Ensure that `Vulnerability assessment for machines` is set to `On`.

Repeat the above for any additional subscriptions.

## Default Value

By default, `Automatic provisioning of monitoring agent` is set to `Off`.
