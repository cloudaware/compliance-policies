description: "This recommendation aims to maintain a balance between security and\
  \ operational efficiency by ensuring that a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 4 users\
  \ are assigned the Global Administrator role in Microsoft Entra ID. Having at least\
  \ two Global Administrators ensures redundancy, while limiting the number to four\
  \ reduces the risk of excessive privileged access."
